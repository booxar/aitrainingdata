{"prompt":"This article is both accurate and highly misleading. The author is correct that there is very little reliable evidence that links glutamic acid and\/or glutamate to health problems. The backlash against MSG as a result of the \"Chinese Restaurant Syndrome\" craze, was not rooted in scientific inquiry.\nHowever, MSG is not just a source for glutamate like seaweed and tomatoes are. MSG is the sodium salt of glutamic acid and contains not just glutamate but also sodium ions. Having 2000mg of natural glutamate should be harmless. Having enough MSG to give you 2000mg of glutamate means you're getting a shit ton of sodium. That's not good for you, especially if you're one of the many people for whom excess sodium intake adversely affects your blood pressure. So while MSG is presumably no worse than NaCl (and is perhaps better in that the umami flavor means you don't have to use as much sodium to get an equally rich taste), to say that MSG is totally harmless without even mentioning sodium and hypertension is ridiculous. Even in terms of short term effects, I've had plenty of MSG-free hot and sour soups that made my head itch. Not from MSG but from thousands of mg of sodium found in their gratuitously added soy sauce and table salt.","completion":"You hit the nail on the head.  For most of us, it's not the MSG that causes the problem.  It's what comes with it.  For starters it's the sodium.

Python 3.4 has generic functions to do single dispatch matching on type.  You can statically type check python now (see pysonar2, pylint, and pycharm for example).  Not only as pypy made a major breakthrough with performant STM based concurrency(no threads), but threading has been improved in python 3 too.

{"prompt":"Very cool, but I sometimes worry that the illusion of safety is more dangerous than the original danger itself.\nIn Boulder, where I live, several crosswalks were identified as being particularly dangerous for pedestrians, and pedestrian crossing signs with big flashing lights were installed at these locations over the past 5 years. This spring, a report was released[1] that showed accidents at many of these crosswalks had actually increased since the lights were installed. \"Taken together, the data suggests that approximately eight additional crossing accidents per year occur at these locations,\" says the report.\nThere are lots of theories about why, but I think it boils down to one thing: when pedestrians can hit a button and light up these big signs which are supposed to make everyone stop, it makes them feel much safer, to the point that many people will hit the button and start walking almost immediately, without taking the time to make sure that all lanes of traffic are aware of their presence and stopping.\nThe prospect of automated cars scares me because, obviously, they cannot be perfect, and they will not be able to identify every dangerous driving scenario. Of course, there is a manual override, but I fear that the car being right 99% of the time will lead to such a complacency in \"drivers\" that, in the 1% of cases where the car is wrong and about to hit something, we will not be able to stop in time. The more accurate the car is, the more safe we feel, and the less likely we are to monitor it as closely and notice when it is wrong.\nAnyway, I rather hope I'm wrong.

That's much safer for both parties.\nThe \"illusion of safety\" is most dangerous at traffic lights. 2-3 times I've had cars just sail through, completely oblivious. Note: they're sailing through on RED lights. Not amber going red. It's not one of those borderline cases.\nOnce I had a cop have a chat to me about jaywalking but I've never been fined. I would be pissed if I ever was. In a fight between a car and a pedestrian the pedestrian loses (big time) so pedestrians have a higher vested interest in their own safety. I know what the light changes are at intersections I cross a lot. Where are these cops when cars sail through red lights or nearly run over pedestrians when turning when the pedestrians have right of way?\nI get the distinct impression these skills will come in handy when I move to New York next month!\nAnyway, back to the self-driving cars: this I believe will be a painful transition that will take many, many years.

Now, as a \"born\" software engineer with a decent portfolio (now age 21) recently frustratated by a fruitless job search, turned down again and again (I believe rightfully so) because the competition all had college degrees, I beg to differ.\nA good college degree (especially in STEM fields) provide the basic foundation upon which to innovate. Our industries have gone so deep, and we are standing on such giant shoulders, that anyone who is going to take it further must first absorb the century or so of knowledge created so far on the subject.

{"prompt":"Over the last decade, the distributed system nature of modern server hardware internals has become painfully evident in how software architectures scale on a single machine. The traditional approaches -- multithreading, locking, lock-free structures, etc -- are all forms of coordination and agreement in a distributed system, with the attendant scalability problems if not used very carefully.\nAt some point several years ago, a few people noticed that if you attack the problem of scalable distribution within a single server the same way you would in large distributed systems (e.g. shared nothing architectures) that you could realize huge performance increases on a single machine. The caveat is that the software architectures look unorthodox.\nThe general model looks like this:\n- one process per core, each locked to a single core\n- use locked local RAM only (effectively limiting NUMA)\n- direct dedicated network queue (bypass kernel)\n- direct storage I\/O (bypass kernel)\nIf you do it right, you minimize the amount of silicon that is shared between processes which has surprisingly large performance benefits. Linux has facilities that make this relatively straightforward too.\nAs a consequence, adjacent cores on the same CPU have only marginally more interaction with each other than cores on different machines entirely. Treating a single server as a distributed cluster of 1-core machines, and writing the software in such a way that the operating system behavior reflects that model to the extent possible, is a great architecture for extreme performance but you rarely see it outside of closed source software.\nAs a corollary, garbage-collected languages do not work for this at all.","completion":"> one process per core, each locked to a single core; use locked local RAM only (effectively limiting NUMA); direct dedicated network queue (bypass kernel); direct storage I\/O (bypass kernel)\nI have no idea how to do any of these things.

{"prompt":"Copied from the other thread, because it bears repeating:\nI think it's important to keep in mind that the 12 vote margin is comfortable for Amash and supporters of new NSA restrictions and uncomfortable for its defenders.\nHere's why: opponents of Amash wielded an argument that \"split the vote\". Representatives who voted against Amash could have done so for one of two reasons:\n(1) They actively support providing the NSA with unchecked access to cell phone metadata under the \"business records\" provision of PATRIOT, or\n(2) They don't support that access, but can't support a broad amendment that potentially de-funds whole NSA programs, and instead need something finer grained to correct NSA with.\nMeanwhile, everyone who supported Amash believes strongly --- so strongly that they're willing to do something disruptive to NSA --- that new checks on NSA are needed.\n(I think Amash was a good amendment, if only because it  would force the House to do its actual job and carefully regulate intelligence collection; if it caused a temporary shitstorm, so much the better --- it'd be a well-deserved comeuppance for a legislature that has been derelict in its duty to oversee these programs.

{"prompt":"> Tesla are a sideshow and we desperately need to stop talking about them, because they're harming efforts to improve energy efficiency.\nCompletely disagree.  Tesla is, I think, unquestionably the most impactful company in the game, including GE and Nissan.  For two reasons.\nFirst, before Tesla people thought of electric vehicles as ridiculous DIY golf carts driven by treehuggers.  They were utterly uncool and stupid.  Post-Tesla, electric cars are among the very coolest cars in the world.  GE didn't do that.  Nissan didn't do that.  Toyota didn't do that.  Tesla did.  I think fundamentally changing people's perceptions of what an electric car is and what it can do is the single most impactful action in the industry so far.\nSecond, Tesla's critical product isn't their cars.  Their critical product is their battery technology.  It is second to none, in a business where the battery is everything.  This is the reason that both Daimler and Toyota have invested in the company.  I think you are seriously underestimating how important this is.\nAs to the article proper: it seems to me that running down your car is a pretty simple problem to engineer away.  This might be an issue, perhaps a burp that Tesla has to get fixed pronto.  But it's hardly, to use the breathless headline, devastating.","completion":"Their critical product is their battery technology.

{"prompt":"If Bitcoin ever graduates to anything more than a toy currency (last count was a billion or two USD globally?) then it's going to have to deal with graduate level problems.  The business cycle is a thing I'm afraid, and the management of a recession to prevent it's becoming a depression is as close to a fusion of science and art as you'll ever see.  The necessity for this isn't going to change as long as the human brain continues to function as it does.\nIn good times people want more money - a discussion on what they should want is irrelevant, lets stick to the facts - and in bad times people want to protect what they have (aggressively so).  Now consider that what makes times good vs bad is not determined by money - it's determined and prolonged by some other shock like an asset misvaluation, the destruction of a massive crop, or some combination of external factors underlying the real or nominal non-money thing.\nLet's say it's a rice crop.  Those dependent on rice freak out, and push all their money into safe assets, those dependent on those dependent on rice do the same.  The chain reaction continues until all the economy's money is tied up in safe assets, not being spent, and everyone is sat at home waiting for it to blow over.  If policymakers do not intervene correctly at this point, this situation will become a depression, and much misery will ensue.\nSo what do we do?  We make safe assets more expensive to lower the risk\/reward ratio for commercial activities: we make bank holdings very unrewarding (lower interest rates), we devalue the money in circulation and provide liquidity in one move (print money), and government invests in big infrastructure (liquidity, jobs, momentum, signalling etc).  All of this is designed to keep things moving and ward off a depression.  And it works - this is why we abandoned the gold standard.\nSo given that Bitcoin means nothing to rice, or most other external factors, and not to the rigidities that exacerbate recessions - how exactly do we deal with this in the described autonomous utopia?\nI very much agree that the regulators of currency leave a tremendous amount to be desired, but unfortunately this appears to be one of very few economic problems where decentralisation is not the answer.","completion":"Consider that with bitcoin the \"safest\" asset is also the most liquid (easiest to exchange)."}

You especially wouldn't let the janitor have an equal say - he's got no experience in desiging such things!\nI'm always very uneasy about equality talks because all people are not equally suited to make global policy decisions. Nor are they equally incentivized to make the most informed and rational decisions.\nI'm not saying that there isn't a problem or that we shouldn't do anything about it, but I am saying that I disagree with an egalitarian approach. We want the majority of decisions to be made by people who understand what they are deciding and have lots of experience, not to be made by individuals who mostly understand the topic from a single reddit thread.

Evil beats XVim hands down, but XVim is a lot better than the others I tried: IdeaVim (for Intellij), Vrapper (Vim for Eclipse), and Vintage (Vim for Sublime).

{"prompt":"Apple's \"Think Different \/ Change the World\" ad was a brilliant piece of marketing.  But it doesn't seem that really stuck as the core value of their brand.  If Nike's message is \"we hang around great athletes,\" Apple's message today is \"we hang around the young and hip,\" [1] which is different than \"we hang around people who change the world.\"\nYou could argue that these are somehow related, that the young and hip would be attracted by the Think Different ad.  I don't dispute that.  But the later ads of kids jamming with their iPod ear buds communicate a message that is much closer to the general perception of Apple as a brand today.\n--\n[1] In the clothing industry, this type of positioning wouldn't be noteworthy or distinguishing.  But in consumer electronics, advertising more like Abercrombie & Fitch and less like IBM has worked out brilliantly for them.\n[2] The pre-2000 perception of Apple's brand was also somewhat tangential to the idea of changing the world.  Their core message was \"we're not IBM.\"  In the talk, Jobs mentions this shouldn't be their core message, but clearly it was.  The 1984 ad reinforced this, and even the 1997 Think Different ad retrenched this ground by riffing off of IBM's motto.\n[3] Edit: The idea that Apple's core customer is someone who \"values their time\" and is not a computer geek is meaninglessly broad.  Every customer values his or her time, and in any mainstream industry, the vast majority of customers are not computer geeks.\n[4] Edit: Was it the success of the iPod that made Apple hip, or was the perception of the iPod being hip part of what made it such a success?  Clearly it did become a fashion accessory.  The product's clean design was congruent with this message.","completion":"we hang around the young and hip\nIs that not the same as Evian's slogan - live young, or pepsi's marketing way back to the younger people.

{"prompt":"Co-founder of Stack Overflow, here.\nA lot of the people who were involved in some way in Experts-Exchange don't understand Stack Overflow.\nThe basic value flow of EE is that \"experts\" provide valuable \"answers\" for novices with questions. In that equation there's one person asking a question and one person writing an answer.\nStack Overflow recognizes that for every person who asks a question, 100 - 10,000 people will type that same question into Google and find an answer that has already been written. In our equation, we are a community of people writing answers that will be read by hundreds or thousands of people. Ours is a project more like wikipedia -- collaboratively creating a resource for the Internet  at large.\nBecause that resource is provided by the community, it belongs to the community. That's why our data is freely available and licensed under creative commons. We did this specifically because of the negative experience we had with EE taking a community-generated resource and deciding to slap a paywall around it.\nThe attitude of many EE contributors, like Greg Young who calculates that he \"worked\" for half a year for free, is not shared by the 60,000 people who write answers on SO every month. When you talk to them you realize that on Stack Overflow, answering questions is about learning. It's about creating a permanent artifact to make the Internet better. It's about helping someone solve a problem in five minutes that would have taken them hours to solve on their own. It's not about working for free.\nAs soon as EE introduced the concept of money they forced everybody to think of their work on EE as just that -- work.","completion":"I come across at least two people every week wanting to learn how to program, instead of giving them a 500-page C book I tell them to go to SO and try to help someone, research on google a random subject\/question etc, then they start the reverse approach towards tools such as \"I think I know how to do this, but how can I run python on my computer?\" instead of installing 80GB of IDEs without knowing what they are for.\nThe results are amazing, they decide their favorite subjects without personal bias (a female friend got ultra hooked on SQL for example, even tho I hate it as a business language) and you just watch them fly.\nI also make sure to point out that the reputation is not a certification of authority or correctness, as I see they are just experience points, just how much you learned while being nice enough to share that experience.\nI am not a fan of the SE network splitting the subjects but understand why it exists right now, but I also think it is just an amazing problem to spend years on."}

{"prompt":"There is a very important question here: What is the relationship between you and the bank?\nUp until recently, it has been considered sacrosanct that deposit holders be protected, no matter the cost.  The convention and social contract has been that you deposit money for safe-keeping in a bank.  We have seen this over the past few years across both Europe and the US, as insolvent banks have been bailed-out, nationalised, given secret loans, so that deposit holders are wholly protected.\nWith Cyprus, this widely held belief is now in tatters.  You as a deposit holder are now a creditor of the bank.  As soon as you lend your money to the bank, it is no longer yours.  The bank will provide you with interest for the duration of the loan.  If the bank is no longer a going concern, you will no longer receive special treatment, but instead you must get in line with other creditors.\nSome may argue that this has always been the case[1], however it will be a genuine shock to many people, and any faith in deposit guarantee schemes has been dealt a severe blow when a week ago, the EU urged Cyprus to collectively punish all deposit holders regardless of balance.\n[1] For those in the UK, the House of Lords said in Foley v Hill 1848 http:\/\/www.uniset.ca\/other\/css\/9ER1002.html\n\"Money, when paid into a bank, ceases altogether to be the money of the principal... The money placed in custody of a banker is, to all intents and purposes, the money of the banker, to do with it as he pleases... he is, of course, answerable for the amount, because he has contracted, having received that money, to repay to the principal, when demanded, a sum equivalent to that paid into his hands... the banker is not an agent or factor, but he is a debtor.\"","completion":"\"... the EU urged Cyprus to collectively punish all deposit holders regardless of balance.\"\nIs this true?

I have never got to the end of one.\nIf you need that much animation on a page to tell your story, isn't it a good sign that video might be more fit for purpose? Video was designed for storytelling, it will work on most devices, and it has well-established UI and conventions, such as a play button and progress bar.\nIf you're going to provide a play button in your scrollmation to automatically advance the action anyway, you've already recognised how irritating it is to manually page through an animated story by scrolling or swiping. So why then go to the trouble of creating a scroll-based animation that repurposes a 20+ year old convention and attempts to reinvent a tiny proportion of what video has to offer?\nIs it just for the novelty value?\nIs it because it makes you feel smarter?\nHow is it better for users trying to understand your story?\nI'd love to hear from anyone who's considered both video and scrollmation and chosen the latter.","completion":"> What motivates web designers to tell stories by repurposing the scroll mechanism instead of, say, using video?\nControl for the users."}

{"prompt":"Hi all. A few clarifications.\n- The meme that we are adding more and more features into the docker binary is unfounded. Please, please, I ask that before repeating it you do your homework and ask for actual examples. For example 1.4 is coming out next week: it has 500+ commits and basically no new features. It's all bugfixes, refactoring and a general focus on quality. That's going to be the trend from now on\n- Swarm and Machine are separate binaries. They are not part of the core docker runtime. You can use them in a completely orthogonal way.\n- Swarm follows the \"batteries included but removable\" principle. We are not doing all things to all people! There is a default scheduling backend but we want to make it swappable. In fact we had Mesosphere on stage today as part of a partnership to make Mesos a first-class backend.\n- there is an ongoing proposal to merge compose into the docker binary.

We may find that strange but if it helps with the adoption of Docker, then it benefits every Docker user and that's ok with me. On the other hand, it is definitely not popular on HN and has the opposite connotation of dorky pencil holder suit douchiness. Being from that tribe I share that instinctive reaction. But I also realize it's mostly psychological. I care less about the specific choice of words than the substance. And the substance here is that we launched a lot of new stuff today, and put a lot of effort in keeping the focus on a small, reliable runtime, composable tools which do one thing well, pluggability, open APIs, and playing nice with the ecosystem.

Just because you think there's something wrong with it, doesn't mean there is something wrong with it. I ran my own consumer electronics retail business for 5 years and about 70% of returns have absolutely nothing wrong with them. NewEgg can't just throw the stuff away, they'd go out of business.\nThey also can't just send the stuff to the manufacturer. The manufacturer doesn't care about your issues and if you return stock of which 70% is functional for warranty service, they will kick your ass.\nSo you hire guys to test the equipment and return it to sell-able condition and sell it as an open-box return.\nBack to our little problem. You bought a laptop. Great! You install Linux on it. Fine! Is it really that much trouble to return it to the same condition when you send it back?\nNewEgg has to hire guys who sit there for hours installing Windows from the non-existent install disks (they don't include those anymore ... you gotta download them) so that they can recoup their losses? It would cost them more than the laptop is worth.\nIf the laptop is truly defective, and you can't install the original operating system as a consequence, NewEgg has no quick means of determining what you did with the system ... and the manufacturer won't care either.\nSo if you buy a laptop and decide to return it, return it to factory condition.

Thinking that somehow this is what 'coding' is, is missing the point.\nI will read a stack overflow page perhaps in a search for some direction, look at all the 'solutions' like surveying a landscape of others approaches to the problem. Then I'll throw them all away and code my own. Possibly it will share a lot with one of the answers, what I would consider a good approach. But a literal copy and paste just doesn't happen. I would consider a copy and paste a recipe for inviting trouble, because you haven't really reasoned through the problem yourself, and thus don't really understand the solution intimately.\nProgramming is a process of mental reasoning around your problem with an eye on the form of reasoning computers use, so you can express that reasoning to the computer in the language you're using. Because computers don't reason like humans 'reason' (ie. humans don't really 'reason'...), knowing how a computer reasons and behaves is alien and takes time to understand and learn and it takes time to become quicker at comprehending this. This is the path of becoming a better programmer. Gaining that experience so the process is less alien and you more easily can fathom how a computer will respond and behave with a certain approach of laying out of the logic you are trying to express.\nCopy and paste doesn't help you at all with this.

{"prompt":"The problem with this article is that a lot of things that are cheap for one serving go stale before you eat the second.\nFor instance, on day one, he adds some mint which cost ~50p to buy, but he calls 1p because he only eats a little. He does not eat the rest of the mint that week, so it cost him ~50p, i.e. half the days budget.\nI am poor and eat very cheap. I do that using dry bulk foods and frozen veg. This is important because there are opportunities for free meals (e.g. if customers at work do not eat all the sand witches and biscuits, that can be lunch for 2 days). Friends invite you for dinner too. If you buy food that spoils, opportunities like this come at a price.\nHow about this for a suggestion - mix lentils, buck wheat, brown rice, dried beans, quinoa. These come in 500g bags for about a pound. You need 6 spoons of this mix per meal, so 10 pounds of mix will last you several months. Put in a rice cooker for 40 min (some beans need soaking first), with a chicken stock cube. Cook for 20 mins then add mixed frozen veg. This will cost you about 30p per meal, and is pretty much complete [1].\nI eat the above most of the time, and take free food whenever possible.

I know fifteen years ago I was making video calls over my GSM phone, chatting with people via SMS, AIM, and ICQ, etc.   Literally nothing in this post is in any way amazing to anyone who actually remembers life ten years ago.  We had smartphones.  We had social media.  We had web forums.  Just because you've dumped money into some of them doesn't make them special or even interesting from a technology standpoint.\nI, too, support SpaceX (as well as Orbital Sciences, Virgin Galactic, etc) but pretending that reddit is even anywhere near that list as far as being \"unimaginably fantastic\" is either depressingly credulous or else clumsy false optimism.\nSpecifically in computing, the past ten or fifteen years have been a war on general-purpose computing; all the brands names he's slinging around amount to a celebration of the black-boxing of internet services.  Ten years ago I could do all this stuff without needing a quad-core 2GHz phone to run a full-featured HTML5\/CSS\/JS browser platform.\nMore generally, in cars, computers, and most other sectors in technology, things are getting less and less accessible to casual interest or even moderately-dedicated hobbyists.  Sometimes it's in the name of efficiency, sometimes it's in the name of corporate control, but with the exception of the Tesla, everything he talks about existed ten years ago in some form.

{"prompt":"I worked at an Apple store for over a year as a \"salesperson\" (we called them Mac Specialists at the time). Let me input my two cents:\nI was trained to do this. From day one of dedicated 8-hour training sessions, we're trained to find customers the right \"solution\" rather than get the most money. This requires using the APPLE technique (acronym, google it). The second P stands for \"Present a solution for the customer to take home today.\" It was common knowledge at the time (4 years ago) that consumers were brainwashed to thinking faster\/more is always better. But when we can save them hundreds of dollars, this isn't the case. There were many many times I talked someone out of a $2,000 MacBook Pro for a $1200 entry-level iMac with double the specs because after probing (the first \"P\") I learned they didn't need to be mobile. This was really, really common.\nAnd note, this isn't about trying to convince people to spend less. Sometimes after probing, we learned they needed _more_. It is about the RIGHT solution.\nTo add to this: specialists don't earn commission. We weren't ranked based on financial sales numbers (there are other metrics, however). There is no incentive for specialists to sell more expensive or less expensive things. It is about the right thing.\nSo, this guy was just doing what he was trained to do. It is Apple store standard.","completion":"I agree that Apple, as the case is at every brick-and-mortar store that I'm loyal to (B&H Photo has often talked me out of expensive purchases), has a great incentive to not oversell an unneeded product.\nHowever, I think we need more data on recommendations before we can argue that the intent is entirely altruistic. As others have said, the low-end model is also the same model as the \"Vanilla\" build, i.e. the model that Apple has plenty of in stock...and a purchase in-store (with the possibility of upselling on other accessories) is more valuable than a purchase from the web. If it's the case that Apple sells a disproportionate amount of its Vanilla stock in-store, then is it coincidence that the Vanilla stock happens to be the perfect fit for so many customers? How many slightly-upgraded (but not in-stock) models are customers convinced to buy...because there has to be at least a few customers for whom the MBP is not ideal, but a slightly upgraded MBA is needed.\nAnd if you want to be totally cynical, you could argue that Apple is ensuring that the customer returns in the nearer future by selling them a less future-proof model. Yes, customers have loyalty based on the reliability of the brand...but if the compassionate-sales-job is so effective, then that alone may be good enough of a memory for the customer to overlook that he\/she is replacing a new laptop a year earlier than expected."}

Actually I think that many people like the idea of their posts are being read by as many people as possible and not just the ones with similar interests. Although it looks like a big discussion group, the news feed is really a giant personality-defining display for vain people.

I have the feeling that most really don't care very much. But ironically, I think the privacy-thing could actually work in facebook's favor. Here is why: I use fb a lot even though I don't like their privacy policies. I trust google more than facebook. Still, it bothers me when it says \"logged in\" in the google bar at the top because google watches my searches. When I am on facebook I behave like I am in public. I don't hope for the best and write secret stuff anywhere.

And god forbid you talk about your emotions...that's a female thing.\nBut the thing is, those activities are what allow us to be vulnerable and what allow us to bond with others. The more you suppress those urges, the more you end up feeling alone.

{"prompt":"Oh for heavens' sakes. Yet more ignorance.\nA more realistic view of C:\n- C is straightforward to compile into fast machine code...on a PDP-11. Its virtual machine does not match modern architectures very well, and its explicitness about details of its machine mean FORTRAN compilers typically produce faster code. The C virtual machine does not provide an accurate model of why your code is fast on a modern machine. The social necessity of implementing a decent C compiler may have stifled our architecture development (go look at the Burroughs systems, or the Connection Machine, and tell me how well C's virtual machine maps to them).\n- C's standard library is a joke. Its shortcomings, particularly around string handling, have been responsible for an appalling fraction of the security holes of the past forty years.\n- C's tooling is hardly something to brag about, especially compared to its contemporaries like Smalltalk and Lisp. Most of the debuggers people use with C are command line monstrosities. Compare them to the standard debuggers of, say, Squeak or Allegro Common Lisp.\n- Claiming a fast build\/debug\/run cycle for C is sad. It seems fast because of the failure in this area of C++. Go look at Turbo Pascal if you want to know how to make the build\/debug\/run cycle fast.\n- Claiming that C is callable from anywhere via its standard ABI equates all the world with Unix. Sadly, that's almost true today, though, but maybe it's because of the ubiquity of C rather than the other way around.\nSo, before writing about the glories of C, please go familiarize yourself with modern FORTRAN, ALGOL 60 and 68, Turbo Pascal's compiler and environment, a good Smalltalk like Squeak or Pharo, and the state of modern pipelines processor architectures.","completion":"> The social necessity of implementing a decent C compiler may have stifled our architecture development\nthe idea that specific requirements of c had started driving architecture development blew my mind the first time i came across it. it is still a point that does not get discussed nearly enough at a popular level."}

Unfortunately, the philosophy course seemed deeply rooted in classical theories like dualism (which I think of as a rationalization for religious dogma), ignoring any and all modern advances in neuroscience. The final straw was the lecture unit on \"artificial minds\". There was a lot of uninformed speculation about AI, which really disappointed me.

The places that were bartering were doing so because it was some low hanging fruit way to increase business and it was easy to to. And they were places that weren't particularly popular on their own (restaurants let's say) so they would do bartering to bring in customers on Monday nights but not allow it for obvious reasons on Saturday or Friday night.  There is always a feeling on the part of small business owners that barter dollars are not real dollars (even though there is value in many cases) and barter business is not real business.  A place that isn't doing that well to begin with (and once again I realize this is a generalization that is not true in many cases) is not going to have the best employees or the best attitudes because they are running short on cash and can't pay the best wages or have the best working conditions. So it's an entire ecosystem of mediocrity that you (in your case or me in my case) might end up experiencing.\nSo I guess in theory someone taking groupon (or barter dollars) should just be a regular business that is doing well wanting to increase business. But in actual cases it might more often (from my experience at least) be a marginal business that is trying to fix a situation with marketing that isn't exactly going to work as planned by bringing in groupon dollars or barter dollars (that will end up being used by the owner to go out to dinner with his wife (and yes that is what happened)). Valuable things (in the case of barter dollars) that a business needs are not typically available with barter dollars. What you get is a bunch of things like dining, travel or accountants or attorneys (and how many of those do you need)."}

And it will cost a bit more than $200 (though the Nexus 5at $349 isn't too far off).\nOn the other hand, if you're fed up with your carrier and would like to switch, you're free to do so. I just did it with AT&T. Walked into a T-Mobile store, asked them to transfer our numbers. The next day I called AT&T and asked, \"how much do I owe for the ETF?\" I paid the $225\/phone (that's how fed up with AT&T I was) over the phone with AT&T. Wait a few days for their accounting system to catch up, go to the web page and enter the IMEI for both phones, and two days later the phones are unlocked. Slapped the T-Mobile SIMs into the iPhones and we were on the air.\nI just don't get the sentiment of \"unlock my free-with-contract phone two months into my contract, you bastards!\" It's not your phone.

Over time, service providers develop a relationship with their customers based on knowledge of that customer.  This knowledge helps inform how they provide and improve their service.

That's it. If it doesn't do that - it's useless.\nBitcoin incentivises hoarding - the opposite of value transmission - and that's the main reason it'll remain as nothing more than a mere speculative currency, like modern day tulips, and why it won't ever become an actual alternative to actual cash.\nNow - this isn't a knock against crypto-currencies - which are awesome - it's merely a knock at the fact that monetary supply in the bitcoin system isn't adaptive. Bitcoin needs a central decentralized bank that will help to stabilise the system and inflate (punish hoarders) as the economy grows in fits and starts.\nI'm sure that one day in the not too distant future, another crypto-currency will come about that takes all the advantages provided by bitcoin, and combines them with stability\/incentives of a nation-backed currency such as the US dollar. When that happens, we can finally end the monopoly held by large financial institutions that so clearly have literally no idea what they are actually doing (see Deutsche bank just recently).\nBitcoins are just the beginning of a whole new financial world, free from restriction, fees and abuse (hopefully :).\nBut they most certainly are not the end.","completion":"Additional issues with bitcoin include significant and growing implementation complexity, legal environs, and latency."}

Google isn't the Oracle of the world where Oracle releases a product, charges you out the wazoo, gives you 24\/7 support and only enter the market of said product after researching if it is a good business investment or not. Google is the one who experiments, tests, lets you use for free, and either retires or promotes projects which turn out to be good for the company (either tech wise, or to the dismay of HN money wise). That's their MO.\nGoogle and Facebook allow you to export your data for most of their services, and I think we can all agree that Google at least are good at giving users a fair amount of heads up before they sunset a product (or should we call it an experiment?).\nIt seems the prevailing notion on HN anymore is once you are a big company (bad), any service you offer the internet no matter how long ago, should be kept around indefinitely, because you are a big company (bad) and you now make a lot of money (bad). Therefore you should let everyone free ride on your platform so that fellow (broke) startups can bootstrap themselves off your prior work (good).

{"prompt":"Ok, there's a lot to cover here.\nFirst off, the Apache Software Foundation isn't trying to absorb anyone or anything. Projects and people come to the ASF. It's a specific policy of the Foundation to NOT solicit projects. If someone says they're representing Apache and soliciting projects, they're wrong.\nSecondly, Apache is very opinionated about how projects should be run. This comes from years of experience as not only a successful project, but as a successful non-profit organization overseeing dozens of projects. If a community doesn't like the ASF's style or rules (such as no dictators, benevolent or otherwise), they don't need to be there. No one wants to keep projects hostage. Part of the point of the Incubator is to get this figured out earlier than later.\nThirdly, about git and subversion. First off, there's increasing support for git at Apache (see http:\/\/git.apache.org\/) but there are some serious drawbacks for use of git. Consider this: subversion was practically made for Apache in the way Linus made git for Linux. With that in mind, subversion isn't going anywhere at the ASF. Some of the rational is just plain stubbornness, but some of it goes straight to the core values of the Foundation.\nApache has become, for better or worse, the place where lots of projects go when they grow up. Growing up is hard to do. It's not fun. You have to do things like get a job, pay taxes, etc. When a project grows up, people start caring about who contributed what, under which license and making sure every line of code is legit. A lot of engineers don't care about this, but businesses and their lawyers do. A lot of the Apache Foundation \"bureaucracy\" is to handle this oversight and paperwork.\nGit is an impressive tool and github is awesome for what it is, but it's not a non-profit foundation and it won't replace one. Confusing the Apache Software Foundation for your coding sandbox only suggests you don't understand the true purpose of either.","completion":"what about Subversion goes \"straight to the core\" of the ASF that is not also true about git?"}

You simply can't drive all the conversations that happen about your company and product. If your success is determined by your necessity to drive the conversations, you're going to lose badly. The interview with PG notwithstanding, you have a company to run and marketing and sales to tackle -- the latter two of which are notoriously hard to control the conversation.\nI see the YCombinator interview as a minimal test - if you can pass that barrier, then you have a chance at possibly getting your customers to understand what you have and its value.

Well it is better than the PC, because I can lie down in bed, or on the couch, or on the front porch, or in the back-yard, or anywhere else for that matter, instead of sitting in a computer chair at a desk (I do that all day at work, why would I want to do it at home?). I prefer the touch-screen interface, and I like the fact there are many dedicated apps rather than just using a webpage. For example, I find browsing youtube using the Android app far more enjoyable than browsing it in a webpage. To me, the touchscreen is not just a convenient alternative to the mouse for tablet-style devices, it has ushered in a new paradigm for interacting with applications, it makes the UX that much better.\nIt is better than a phone, mainly because of screen size.

Make no mistake, this is as much a PR ploy by Tesla to pump up their offering.\nIt's incredibly smart for Musk and company to raise money in a very favorable environment as TSLA climbed from 45 to 90 after earnings. However, it remains to be seen if they can be still profitable. Note that they are still selling each car at a material loss; and only managed to show a profitable quarter by trading green credits they gained from their manufacturing. To truly scale, they need to either drive down the production cost of their cars down and broaden their market as there are only so much supply of carbon-emission credits on the market.\nDisclosure: I trade TSLA options on volatility, without any directional bias.","completion":"I'm looking at the 'Not Cool Dude' button."}

Naturally he was very involved in the process, but the decision was ultimately made by the board (which Sposato was not on). I can tell you that it was not an easy choice. \n3) Picnik was not a \"photo-sharing\" site, it was a photo editing site with very limited photo sharing.\n4) \"One-third of our 25-person team, including my two business partners, quit right off the bat\u201d.

So this time I played with React for about a month, then went to Angular (coincidently starting with React components and being an Angular virgin made me think of making everything isolated-scope directives in Angular).\nSo the problem for me was not React being bad or Angular better but at the end of the day it has to do with: As a non-fulltime webdev I need a _complete_ widget\/component library available for when I want to build my apps.  With React I felt like I was constantly either having to look for components that kind-of\/sort-of worked for me but had some short falls or I had to build them from scratch.  Then there's the look and feel so you're either looking for components that are Bootstrap ready or Material Design-ish, etc.  Even then, you take Angular Material: it's not there yet. Go to the website.  That side-nav menu they have going is really nice.  I wanted to use that in my app. Is that an MD component? Nope.  It's a hacked together mess of custom things. Talk about \"eating your own dog food\".\nIs this common place in the web world right now? Regardless of choosing React\/Angular\/whatever.  I mean I'm used to QT.  There's a widget for just about anything.  You just wire up your events and you have an app.  It seems like the web world is slowly just going to end up reinventing Delphi at the end of the day when I look at things like Polymer (why has it taken so long?)\nAll these frameworks are great but can we please just work on having feature-rich components\/widgets now.  And maybe keep them maintained for the next 5 years or so?","completion":"Unless you're working on a big project you should stick with Jquery \/ Jquery UI.

No amount of tech industry pr can facilitate a comeback from that. Almost half of the people in this country will always see Snowden as a traitor.\nGovernment surveillance has become a political wedge issue, similar to abortion. No one likes it or encourages it but people have strong emotions on both sides. Snowden is deserving of credit, he may have helped to spark another enduring and polarizing american social debate. It's unfortunate that he won't be around for the resulting legal process.\nIt's worth noting that the modern surveillance state didn't begin when Edward Snowden stepped in front of a camera for the first time. Where were these responsible tech giants five or ten years ago? When everyone in the country was flipping the heck out over 9\/11, some of these companies went along with the crowd and gave the government access to everything. Their points are very valid, more government transparency and accountability is always good. But courage is about doing the thing when it's hard, not when it's easy. It's good to see movement in the right direction but it would have been nice if things had gotten to this point sooner. Then maybe Snowden would still be sleeping in his own bed.","completion":"We got laws protecting whistleblowers of big corporations.

{"prompt":"When I was in college, one CS professor explained the difficulty of coding to me in terms of discreteness vs continuity. In the real world, things are continuous. If you accidentally build your structure with 9 supports instead of 10, then you only lose 10% of the strength of the structure, more or less. The strength varies continuously with the amount of support. But if you're writing a 10-line program and you forget one of the lines (or even one character), the program isn't 10% wrong, it's 100% wrong. (For example, instead of compiling and running correctly, it doesn't compile at all. Completely different results.)\nOf course this logic doesn't hold up all the time. Sometimes you can remove a critical support and collapse a structure, and sometimes removing a line of code has little to no effect, but the point is that in programming, a small change can have an unboundedly large effect, which is the definition of discontinuity.\n(I believe it was this professor, who was my teacher for discrete math: http:\/\/www.cs.virginia.edu\/~jck\/ )","completion":"i say its \"brittle\" ...those words discrete and continuous dont really apply cleanly, though i understand the idea somewhat intuitively"}

If I found a good driver back in the day I would get his phone # and take him exclusively to the airport. Uber solved this with UberX and by having a wealth of seemingly skilled drivers that made it a true on demand service.

For frequent business travelers, finding the right place at the right price is awesome and I would usually try to stay at the same place and connect with people directly. AirBnB solved this with overwhelming demand for the service (the place I like may not always be available) and with their insurance policy and scheduling tools for renters.\nIn any event, I don't feel like HomeJoy failing is indiciative of a bubble in the On Demand economy.

Like any other new language, it's a new, strange thing to learn, there's new tools and a new compiler, and your team doesn't already know it.\nIn addition, CoffeeScript has it's own distinct burden to bear: the entire point is to compile (in as straightforward a fashion as we can manage) into JavaScript. That you're debugging JavaScript when you run CoffeeScript in production should be no surprise -- that's the point.

So, Chrome uses whatever encrypted storage the system provides to keep your passwords safe for a locked account.

Said bad guy can dump all your session cookies, grab your history, install malicious extension to intercept all your browsing activity, or install OS user account level monitoring software. My point is that once the bad guy got access to your account the game was lost, because there are just too many vectors for him to get what he wants.\nWe've also been repeatedly asked why we don't just support a master password or something similar, even if we don't believe it works. We've debated it over and over again, but the conclusion we always come to is that we don't want to provide users with a false sense of security, and encourage risky behavior. We want to be very clear that when you grant someone access to your OS user account, that they can get at everything.

Sell their home in SF (if they own), and buy a nicer\/roomier place in the new location.\nPhoenix in particular has a pretty thriving tech community, and a far better cost of living.

{"prompt":"This is an important article, but I doubt there will be a useful discussion of it here.\nThe developed world has incredible productive capacity. With 1% of the workforce in agriculture and 8% in manufacturing, the US produces as much stuff as China.  There are no significant shortages of any manufactured good anywhere in the developed world. Quality is pretty good across the board, too. This is unique in history.\nThat's great. But there's less productive work to go around. We're out of buying power. Labor is worth less because there's a labor glut. Our economic system can't cope with that.  On top of this, more of what most people can do is being automated, and for less money. Automation used to be expensive. Now, if a computer can do it, it will be far cheaper than a human.\nThe financial system has become primarily self-serving, running on self-generated zero-sum tasks.  It's part of the problem, not part of the solution.  If we had a capital shortage, that might be a problem. Instead, we have a capital glut, and no place to put it that produces good returns on investment.  This is \"secular stagnation\", as the article puts it.\nJapan hit this around 1989, when their real estate bubble collapsed.  Japan never came back from that.  There was hope that the Japanese would figure out something.  25 years later, they haven't. They've built up their safety net and put money into infrastructure projects, so that fewer people are suffering.  That's the best they could come up with.\nWe have no successful model for dealing with this.  What capitalism gives us by default is a small number of rich people and a large number of poor people competing for a shrinking pool of low-paying jobs.  Nobody really knows what to do about this, including the people who say they do.","completion":"Sorry, but the financial system exists at the behest of the political class. The political class is the one percent who runs it all. They may talk that we have a capitalist society but with the heavy amount of regulation that exists that is pretty much a stretch.

You thwart them and its pretty damn sure within a few short years what you do is illegal or your paying off through someone's campaign.\nShovel ready jobs, the ACA, none of this was done to benefit the everyday worker, their employment or fulfillment were not part of the equation."}

Leave your stuff there to claim the seat. Then go back to the 1st floor counter, order and get your drinks\/food, wait to receive them, walk back to your stuff.\nThe point you should get from this is that PEOPLE IN YOUR COUNTRY SUCK AND YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED YOU LIVE IN SUCH A SHITTY CULTURE AND THAT YOU TAKE IT FOR GRANTED THAT YOU HAVE TO PROTECT YOUR STUFF BECAUSE PEOPLE WILL STEAL IT.\nAfter living in a country with very little violence, a country where you don't have to pull your car radio out of your car, where you don't have worry about what alleys you walk down, a country where if you leave your bags or wallet on a train you'll get them back, I was very ashamed of my own country, the USA, where I used to think I was safe but in reality I'd just learned to avoid the ever present danger rather than do something to fix it.\nNow comes all the replies telling me how much Japan sucks in other ways.

Boom, brand loyalty is gone, nobody would go to their \"favourite\" store any more because there would be no favourites.\nYes, big stores like walmart and competitors compete on $0.01 (and openly advertise that they're $0.01 cheaper) but any store that isn't providing grocery type items doesn't, although maybe England is unique and in America it's different?

{"prompt":"Can you argue that there is ever a social (not private) benefit to NOT open sourcing your code?","completion":"A lot of serious security advisories affecting closed source programs often don't become exploits in the wild due to the nature of closed source and the impied secrecy involved.\nFor example, IE had a major, major issue regarding SChannel that more or less trivially gave attackers an ability to run arbitary code at either admin or SYSTEM level. It was scary. It was reported privately and then patched.  Never in this process did anyone have the source code to analyze and publish an early PoC like they did shellshock and heartbleed. When the patch was released, it was a binary, so no one could just compare the old code to the new and figure out exactly what the problem was and launch an attack. Sure, they could analyze the binary, but that gives limited and often unusable results. Or at the very least puts up enough barriers to buy time for patch installs.\nIts funny, years ago we used to worry about our Windows servers, now only worry about our linux servers. FOSS's transparency is ugly when it comes to exploits because they go from discovered to in the wild very, very quickly. Even when they don't, once the patch is released, the hackers have the exploit instantly, and that means if your organization can't patch for a couple hours, you're screwed. The recent Drupal exploit is a good example of this. It went from published to bots hacking Drupal installs within seven hours. Millions of sites were affected."}

{"prompt":"It's interesting that someone who professes loving to program in Perl refers to it as \"PERL\". People who refer to it in all-caps instantly give themselves away as outsiders to the language. It's like someone claiming to be a senior JAVA programmer, it's not an acronym.\nAnyway we use Perl pretty much exclusively at Booking.com, and I'm pretty sure we're at least a couple of orders of magnitude bigger than the likes of Crowdtilt. There's a bunch of other interesting companies using Perl as well, a lot of them just don't make as much of a fuss about it as the companies using say Ruby.\nLast I knew e.g. Morgan Stanley used it for most everything, including new developments, and it alone probably employs more programmers using it than the combined hobbyist contributor base of some newer emerging languages.\nIt's pretty hard to claim that Perl is \"dead\" and square that with the ongoing activity on the CPAN (https:\/\/metacpan.org\/recent). This is not the kind of activity a dead language gets.\nI think what a lot of people mix up is that just because something isn't as big as it was before doesn't mean it's dead.\nC isn't as big relatively as it was in the 80s, Perl isn't relatively as ubiquitous for scripting and web development as it was in the 90s, but neither of those languages are dead.\nIf you look at the total amount of contributions \/ software written for any of the languages that aren't currently in the spotlight you'll most likely find that we're at the high water mark of the number of the amount of software written in them, and the number of people that have been employed to write software in them, just because the industry as a whole is getting bigger every day.\nMaybe they're not bigger relatively compared to some other languages.

They may be contacting the researchers with questions about this demo if they weren't consulted in advance.\n4) What's the plan if they trigger a bug in the car software of the people they had tested this with earlier? The article mentions them tracking people remotely as they attempt to learn more about the exploit.\nI could go on but why bother? In case any of you think this was cool or even remotely (no pun intended) ethical, I'd like to know if you have a problem with letting these two test this on a loved one's car.

But this is to be expected of companies of gargantuan size, and is certainly not limited to Microsoft alone (although recently they've had more than their fair share).\nMy qualm with Microsoft is all the little things that they let slip through. Little things like having a control panel with 100 different links with nondescript names.

{"prompt":"My dad works in the airplane industry and had an interesting story to tell me that relates to this. (I'm not sure exactly how accurate it is or what the source is, sorry). Apparently, it is illegal for pilots to read while flying. Even if they are heading in a straight line with no one around for miles. This is because one time an pilot wasn't paying attention and due to a series of software failures, the plane turned into a mountain. Interestingly, the plane was tuning at a very exact amount so that the number of Gs remained constant.\nIn any case, this single crash caused regulation to state that computers can never fly planes by themselves. This strikes me as rather unfair. If a single human crashed a plane, it does not make it illegal for humans to fly planes by themselves.\nAnother example is that in London, subways must be driven by a human. Even though driving a subway may be trivial (there is no way to steer), Londoners apparently do not feel comfortable being driven by a non-living thing. They want to be sure that if they die, the driver dies too, adding a level of accountability.\nIt seems that this sort of wide-spread mistrust of machines is driven more by socially normal paranoia than any kind of logic. I for one am rooting for machines to take over all forms of driving. There may be a few mishaps, but it will probably become hundreds of times safer eventually.","completion":"The pilot should be there when the Software fails, and that's why he shouldn't be busy with something else.

We didn't vote to impose taxation for fun; we did so because we hold that society should provide certain things for the people. Avoiding making a fair contribution to the various common services for which tax is used - whether that be defence, social security, education or healthcare - is so obviously evil that I'm seriously struggling to understand your position here. Surely you're not claiming that morality is defined by law and anything legal must be moral (and vice versa)?\nThe track records of countries without government is not exactly stellar either."}
{"prompt":"What I find striking is that someone working at a gas station, and with apparently no formal CS education, could get hired and eventually become a lead developer, at Microsoft.  Google would never hire someone like Zeke (they might have in the past, but not current Google); without a degree from a \"top-tier school\", you don't even get past the first steps of the interview process.\nSay what you will about IE (Zeke is apparently lead on the project), Microsoft actually does have a lot of good software developers working there.  I can't imagine someone would rise to a lead role on a major product like IE without being pretty damned good.  And, there probably is something to hiring really passionate people over someone with a lot of qualification who could take it or leave it...companies like Google that weed out first based on school and grades, might just be missing out on a huge class of talent.\nI can think of a few well-known examples of this (jwz, most of the 8-bit game developers, John Carmack, etc.).  Not to say the guy responsible for IE is necessarily in that class...but, nonetheless, there's an awful lot of great developers who never went to a good school for CS.","completion":"Google would never hire someone like Zeke (they might have in the past, but not current Google); without a degree from a \"top-tier school\"\nIf this is true, this is disempowering to Google for 2 reasons:\n1.  Many potential superstars simply never get the opportunity to go to a \"top-tier school\".\n2.  In applicability to real world requirements, the difference between a \"top-tier school\" and a second level school is negligible.  That is, if there was a scale of what was important from 1 to 100, with 100 as a total super star, then a top-tier school would make you a 10 instead of a 9.  Big deal."}

I mean how many John Smiths can there be in this world and god forbid if one of them decides to do something \"special\". What about other attributes ? Is it really hard to have the unique key as (first name,last name, gender, age, place of birth, citizenship, blah blah) instead of just (first name, last name) and boom, you are flagged.\nEDIT: Based on some comments, it might be a good idea to have a legal name that is very unique and a social name\/nickname  that is the usual John Smithy type. This way, when you deal with legal\/customs whatever, use the crazily unique legal name while on the internet, use a nickname.\nAlso, while we are discussing names, I seriously suggest you to register domain names (and gmail\/fb whatever) for yourself and kids if not already.

{"prompt":"It's great to see some objective research being done on this, and I am very interested in following the results.\nThey mention evaluating the effectiveness of giving a candidate a project to do \"in their own time.\" I recently had a interview that included this and I can share the result: I accepted an offer from a different company that didn't require it. I doubt my life is that different than anyone else's, with a full-time job and a full-time life outside of work. Spending that much time to qualify for a single job is too much to ask of anyone. If it were to pass a generic proficiency certification applicable to many positions, I would consider it, but this does not scale if a candidate is applying for multiple positions.","completion":"I think the take-home project can be successful, but not as most companies implement it.\nA basic rule of courtesy is that a company shouldn't ask the candidate to invest more time in the process than they are willing to invest.\nMost companies will spend an hour or half an hour talking to you on the phone and then give you a project that takes at least 8 hours to do. That's a ridiculous ask. It assumes that the candidate already knows they want to work for your company and is willing to invest that much time to get the job.\nThey forget that an interview is a 2-way street. The candidate is also deciding if the company is the right fit for them, and being asked to invest a ton of your own time when the company doesn't seem willing to invest theirs is a huge turn off.\nThere are a lot of advantages to a take-away task - such as being able to write actual code with a computer on your own stack as opposed to just writing on a white board (which some people have problems doing).\nHowever, this type of ask should only come after both the company and the individual have already invested significant and equal amounts of time - enough time for the candidate to be sure (or fairly confident) the company is a place they'd like to work. This means the take-away may only be useful after the on-site, or possibly right before it but after a few rounds where the candidate gets to understand the company better."}

{"prompt":"Founder of JotForm here. I\u2019d like to thank you all for your sympathy.\nJotForm.com has been suspended by Godaddy for more than 24 hours now. They have disabled the DNS without any prior notice or request. They have told us the domain name was suspended as part of an ongoing law enforcement investigation. In order to resolve the issue, they asked us to contact the officer in charge at U. S. Secret Service.\nWhen I contacted the Secret Service, the agent told me she is busy and she asked for my phone number, and told me they will get back to me within this week. I told them we are a web service with hundreds of thousands of users, so this is a matter of urgency, and we are ready to cooperate fully. I was ready to shutdown any form they request and provide any information we have about the user. Unfortunately, she told me she needs to look at the case which she can do in a few days. I called her many times again to check about the case, but she seems to be getting irritated with me. At this point, we are waiting for them to look into our case.\nOur guess is that this is probably about a phishing form. We take phishing very seriously. Our Bayesian phishing filter has suspended 65.000 accounts last year. We have been training it for many years, so it can detect phishing forms with great accuracy. We also take any reports about phishing very seriously and quickly suspend the accounts and let the other party know about it. By the way, we are also very serious about false positives. If we suspend an account accidentally, we will quickly resolve the issue, and apologize.\nI believe this can happen to anybody who allows users to create content on the web. So, if you have such business, my recommendation would be to make sure that you can contact your most active users quickly if your domain is disabled. Many of our users are shocked and angry at us. But, many also thanked us for quickly letting them know about the issue by email and providing instructions to continue operating their forms. Since DNS propagation takes some time, many active users were able to switch their forms to the new domain before it went down. We still have not contacted all users, we are sending emails most active users first.","completion":"They also did that to me a few years ago, golden rule #1 don't host any domain of value with godaddy"}

{"prompt":"What is the difference between software as a tool and something mechanical as a tool?  Mechanical devices, for which there are many patents, take a state of matter and change it to another state of matter.  Why should you be able to patent a circuit board, but not a set of program code that does exactly the same transformation to a set of bits?\nWhy are mechanical engineers able to patent their devices, but computer engineers are not?\nI understand the ramifications of software patents. But the problems with software patents are the same for patents in every other field.  Why is software special?\nWhy are we narrowing the conversation to software?  Patents for software, like any other field require research and development, they save time and money, they make things more efficient, they improve life for countless individuals, they do require risk, innovation, and yes reward to survive.\nThat's what patents are for.  They are to reward the risk takers.  In the case of software patents, the reward goes to the programmers who take the risk to write all the code that will be patented.

They control the physical world in previously unidentified ways.\nTo say software patents are invalid or software can't be patented really puts software programmers at a disadvantage relative to other fields of science and innovation.

{"prompt":"From first-hand experience, I can say that React+Flux has scaled well to 8+ developers over 800+ JS files and ~60k lines of code in a large single page app here at Facebook. I'm happy to answer any questions! Some things that we've struggled with:\n1. All data should be kept in stores. You may have some local component state, but it shouldn't be anything you want to persist if the component is unmounted. We have tried using state several times, and always go back to keeping it in singleton stores. It also works better with the action-dispatcher pattern.\n2. Now all your data is in stores, but how do you get it into the specific component that needs it? We started with large top level components which pull all the data needed for their children, and pass it down through props. This leads to a lot of cruft and irrelevant code in the intermediate components. What we settled on, for the most part, is components declaring and fetching the data they need themselves, except for some small, more generic components. Since most of our data is fetched asynchronously and cached, we've created mixins that make it easy to declare which data your component needs, and hook the fetching and listening for updates into the lifecycle methods (componentWillMount, etc).\n3. Actions don't have callbacks, as they are by design fire-and-forget. So if you need to be notified when some item has finished being created, for example, you need to listen for the follow up action that the CREATE action fires (yeah, actions firing actions, a bit ugly). Even then, how do you know that CREATE_COMPLETED action correlates to the CREATE that you fired, and not another? Well, actions also come with a payload, so what we ended up doing was passing a context object into the payload and plumbing it all the way down into the CREATE_COMPLETED and CREATE_FAILED actions. Being really strict about actions is a major reason why Flux has scaled well for us.","completion":"do you just not use react state at all then? I have a similar sized app as you, we started off naively using state at various levels, over time we refactored the state higher and higher, and now we are at the point where all the state is kept only at the root of the view hierarchy (we use cursors). We're about one step away from lifting even that state out of react and into a store layer that has no react dependencies."}

{"prompt":"Against my better judgement I'm going to attempt to contribute to this thread. There are good arguments on both sides but most people are talking past one another. As I see it, it comes down to this:\nUber says there is a surplus, people driving cars with empty seats, and they attempt to capture that surplus. From an economic point-of-view that is a good argument. The surplus undeniably exists, and it would be beneficial to reduce it.\nThe argument on the other side is that this is an issue of public policy. Various countries have decided it is beneficial to legislate people driving strangers in exchange for money. The general arguments are ones of safety, but quality of service also comes into it. Again this is a reasonable argument. There is an information asymmetry when hiring a taxi (I don't know what kind of driver I'm going to get) so legislation reduces that.\nThe main point seems to be who gets to decide public policy? Uber and \"Silicon Valley\" types believe that private individuals and companies should be allowed to set public policy. Most others reject this.\nThe next argument is whether current legislation is appropriate and whether Uber has sufficient features to make existing legislation unnecessary. E.g. are ratings and ubiquitous GPS sufficient to reduce information asymmetry. If Uber wants to engage in this argument it should use the usual methods of setting public policy. I don't know if Uber has started any court cases but I expect they will be involved in some soon if not already, and this is one way to effect public policy.","completion":"How about the concept of freedom?\nAm I, as a human being on this planet free?\nIn that context, shouldn't I be able to exercise my option to make choices such as whether I want to use a government-sanctioned transportation service or pay an equally free individual for transportation services.\nBoth kinds of services get to make me an offer and I chose, not government, I.

We agree on that I'm sure. But so does a web browser. So does the operating system it runs on.

I need per-element @media queries, and the ability for elements to peek inside and count their contents so I can make it fit into the space better. JavaScript lets me to do that, but I'm afraid that if you disable JavaScript from today forward you're going to run into this a lot more.\nIt doesn't take a whole ton of JavaScript to supercharge a CSS layout, but if you block all JS you're going to be looking at a broken page.\nI use text-mode browsers on the command-line, and for checking the source of pages from the command-line so I understand when there's a time and place for restricted browsing and it's less useful than a full browser to me because of it.\nHaving said all that, would you mind explaining why you choose to break your exerience of the web by disabling JavaScript, and what gains you perceive from the exercise.

Yes, they have a very nice and educated workforce that will be ready to work and be very productive at a big company where they will work hard, sure, but will come out with the least amount of new ideas (that's not their job), and will do the things most likely to be accepted by the majority.","completion":"I don't see the connection here.\n  In the US you have millionaires came out of \"nothing\" (of course, from nice universities, nice contacts, etc), people jumping at opportunities, while in Europe this would take 2 meetings, 3 viability studies and 4 months.\n\n\nThat is a really narrow view and a myth that is just not applicable to the majority of people.\nBesides extreme things like Facebook, most people of the US are stick to their destiny.

Of course those are presented everywhere, to prove the US dream.\nPeople like Bill Gates never came from poor destiny. Gates parents already where rich. The rich in the US also provide, that people from lower classes don't enter theirs.

{"prompt":"Whether Bitcoin was designed as a scam, I'm not too interested.  Whether Bitcoin today operates as a scam, I'm not too interested.  The fraudulent nature and qualities often discussed don't interested me too much.  There is a deeper issue I've raised, that I've never seen satisfactorily addressed, with Bitcoin:\nIt has economic assumptions baked into it (deflationary, fixed size of money pool, etc).  These assumptions, like all economic assumptions built into a currency, will guide and govern people's behavior and use of it.  That means that bitcoin is a human-invented system that, if it came into any widespread adoption, would play a role in suggesting or controlling people's behavior, just like any currency.\nThe difference is, the people whose behavior would be controlled have no say in changing those economic assumptions.  The people who could potentially live in a bitcoin-infused world have no voice in how it operates.  Bitcoin, in effect, takes a degree of agency from the people, and this is especially problematic if it became widespread enough that you'd be compelled to use it.\nWhy does that matter?  Because people have a right to democratic institutions.  People have a right to vote on or have a say in matters that govern their lives.  Bitcoin, as it exists now, takes that away from people.\nAnd, to bring up a couple of things people have said to be me here before, the fact that Bitcoin can be changed (i.e. by writing new code and persuading 100% of the community to adopt it) does not make it democratic.  Setting the barrier to democratic participation at \"learn to code, or pay someone to code, and then change everyone over all at once to your new software\" means that that isn't really a democratic system at all.\nAnd to bring up the point that currency shouldn't be democratically decided, well, no.  People have a right to govern their affairs and live in a society responsive to their needs.  Moving in the direction of taking some of that agency away is moving in the wrong direction.\nI'm not opposed to digital currency in general, but I am opposed to one that operates in a way that I have no democratic recourse if I don't like how it runs.","completion":"The laws of physics and mathematics aren't democratic, and that is a strength."}

Unless you click on a link, marketers will have no idea the e-mail has been seen.\nAbsurdly wrong, marketers already use a unique image URL for each email recipient, and Google has no way to know that all of those point to the same image. So they won't see \"a single request from Google\", they'll see one request from Google per successful delivery to an inbox.\nNow, an open question is if Google will make that request when the email is actually opened, which would allow marketers to determine if and when the email was read by the user, or if Google will make the request as soon as the email is received. The latter would enhance users' privacy at the cost of bandwidth for Google, but early tests indicate that they don't actually do that, waiting for the user to click the email to make the request.\nI'd like to add that there's no possibility the Gmail team is stupid enough to not have considered this. They must know full well what they're doing, and marketing this as a privacy enhancement when it's actually detrimental to privacy is willfully dishonest.","completion":"> They'll see one request from Google per successful delivery to an inbox\nBut if the images are pre-cached before the user opens it, there is still no way of knowing the E-mail was read.\nUnless the image is cached upon opening, which is a bit counter-intuitive."}

Likewise with games, or video codecs, or 3D rendering, or whatever else was processor-intensive.\nBut that clearly hasn't happened. Instead, GPU's took off as the main computational supplement to CPU's.\nDoes anyone here have any insight as to why? Is there a technological reason why FPGA's never turned into general-purpose hardware standard on every desktop and laptop? Has it been a chicken-and-egg problem? A standardization problem? Or something else? Do FPGA's still have potential for general-purpose consumer computing?

If they can figure out things that need improving in their code, that weighs heavily in their favour. Usually this is things like comments\/documentation, tests, improving the structure or reusability. If it's really good, I'll throw a hypothetical idea for refactoring at them and see how they think.\nThe reason this works is that, despite Hacker News\/Paul Graham dogma to the contrary, \"smartness\" isn't the only thing that matters in programmers.

{"prompt":"As someone with depression, personally I wouldn't recommend mushrooms to others in a similar situation. I've tried them once and it was a rather uncomfortable experience. In fact, a quote from the acticle describes my experience fairly well - \"When suffering depression, people get stuck in a spiral of negative thoughts and cannot get out of it\". This does tend to describe my thought process in general, but this was exacerbated on mushrooms. I had little control over my thought process, which made me anxious, which made the experience harder to deal with. Although, when considering certain personal issues at the time which would normally cause me anxiety, they did feel much less significant.\nThat said, I've heard many stories of people experiencing life changing epiphanies from mushroom trips as described in the article, and I am intrigued by articles like this and the science behind it. Perhaps my environment, or the specific mushrooms I tried made it worse. Also, having tried them once and come out the other end fine may make future experiences less uncomfortable - a large part of what made it difficult was a concern that my mental state would be permanently affected by the experience, and this was not the case. Still, it makes me less inclined to try them again until I'm in a better mental state.\nFor what it's worth, these were the variety of \"magic truffles\" which are legal and readily obtainable from high street stores in Amsterdam, but as far as I'm aware the active ingredient is the same psilocybin as other forms of magic mushrooms.

Lots of people who started early coasted or are still coasting. In the 25 years I've been coding, only a few years worth of that time really grew me as a developer, so what you work on has just as much impact as how long you've been working on it.\nWork with a bunch of different enterprise L.O.B. developers to get a sense of what I'm saying here. The average age of a backoffice developer is higher, meaning they have more experience. Hiring in enterprises is regimented, meaning that they tend to come from CS backgrounds. Are they uniformly high quality developers? No. In fact: there's a stigma attached to coming from a long stint in enterprise development.\nAs a lever for getting more women engaged with startups, the idea that an early start is important makes even less sense. Much of the day-to-day work that happens even at companies with difficult problem domains is rote and uncomplicated. A few years experience is more than enough to lead a typical web project, and, more importantly, to have a sense for whether a dev team is firing on all cylinders and to authoritatively manage it.\nObvious subtext\/bias here: I do not believe that starting women in software development earlier is going to resolve the gender gap.

{"prompt":"Of course everyone thinks they always write good clean code and therefore don't need comments to elaborate on what the heck is going on.\nUnfortunately, having been doing this trade for 30+ years, I've found most people write crappy code in a hurry to try to hit some deadline based on incomplete requirements and confusing business rules.  A few precious comments stuck in there can help the next guy, months or years later, figure out what the heck your original intent was or why a block of code exists at all.\nAs I get older, I find it helps me remember what I was doing.\nOne of my software developer friends was fond of saying:  \"the worst code I ever saw was my own!\"\nYES if your code is clean and elegant and well named and clear you don't need to explain anything in common language.\nYES you should strive for such.\nHowever, the REALITY is your code sucks and no one is going to  want to have to figure out what the heck you were doing.  A few comments would really help.\nThe next reality is that the typical developer may be literate in a dozen or more languages and the language du jour that you coded so elegantly in has fallen out of favor and no one remembers those dusty corners you so beautifully exploited to make something work.\nComments would help even more if you learn to use some basic grammar and spelling when you create your comments.  (It doesn't have to be literature, but try to make your comments as readable as you think your code is - please!)  Nothing will turn another developer off to trying to decipher your code than a few comments that make you look like a moron.\nStyle guides that eschew comments, IMO, are counterproductive.  They feed on the developer's ego and disregard reality.\nComments cost essentially nothing to add to your code and can save it from an early death and complete refactoring by the next guy who comes along.","completion":"Well that is ... sad.

And that destroys any argument for Eich's role as CEO creating a conflict with Mozilla's ability to welcome LGBTQ employees and community members.\nYou have a right to work for whom you choose, but not to demand that everyone above you in a company concurs with your political views.

Human-like AI is a dead field, or at least dead as far we can tell.  We're not even sure how to build it because conceptually we don't even have a grasp on consciousness or cognition.\nThen there's the false assumption that we can get to this level before doing things like, say, solving all mental health issues and that it can magically be scaled to super-human speeds.  For all we know cognition happens at a certain speed and any attempts past that are troublesome.

So we create an all-star selection of the human race in one country, make laws that are favorable to people coming\/staying, and the economy explodes.\nWhat I'm not clear on is what the effect of opening the doors to programmers would be. Would truly great companies be started enough that the entire economy is shored up, or would it just dilute the talent pool to the extent that being a programmer isn't a \"special\" job you get paid $150,000\/year for being decent at?

By nearly all objective measures, a good public system is much better than an all-private system and yet, we know this is not compatible with libertarian ideology - you will have to search far and wide to find a libertarian group that supports a public healthcare system.\nLike I mentioned above, the libertarian ideology is one of minimal government, which is sometimes, but not always the best type of government. This is why libertarianism relies on simplistic catch-allisms (government=bad, regulation=bad, private-good) and parodies of reality like Atlas Shrugged and other Ayn Rand fiction-pseudo-philosophy writings and not your idealistic \"engineering and scientific assessment of reality\" idea.","completion":"You seem to believe in a weak central government and strong state governments that try new approaches and get shit done. This is nice, except most libertarians believe in weak governments in all levels of government. No, not a government that works as well, not an efficient government, but a minimal government.\nTo have a minimum, you have to have a set of constraints. There's no reason those constraints could not lead to \"weak governments in all levels of government\"\nI must be misreading you. I keep finding people making these broad over generalizations about libertarianism. Yes, libertarians are for minimal government, but minimal is a term you can drive a truck through. Simply because one libertarian believes that limited government is minimal, tiered, distributed government and another thinks it means single-layer, centralized government doesn't make one person libertarian and another person not.\nThe terms you mention are not simplistic, they are broad. There's a big difference. It lets a lot of people have libertarian leanings and prompts the individual to continue the definition process at a personal level, which is exactly what you want in a democracy, right?"}

{"prompt":"I've seen the following argument a thousand times:\n\"Well the marginal cost of a copy of [some digital good] is 0 so it isn't stealing!\"\nThat argument is actually completly irrelevant.\nI took a train the other night, and there were only 2 people in my whole car. The previous week it was packed. Both times I had to buy a ticket at the same price.\nIf you don't see what that has to do with pirating music (or software, or movies, or TV), then you don't really understand economics.\nEveryone compares it to widgets where there is some fixed cost and some marginal cost, and suddenly the marginal cost is 0 so we should be able to have it for free right? Right?\nWrong. The train has 0 marginal costs, and all fixed costs. Whether that train is empty or full, they pay for the conductor, the engineer, the maitanence and the gas. But you are expected to pay for your ride whether you are 1\/1000th of the total population on the train or 1\/20th. And if you don't pay, you are breaking the law. Stealing services.\nDigital goods are things with a high fixed costs (software developers, authors, directors, actors etc) and 0 marginal costs. There are plenty of other things out there with the same economic model and you are expected to pay for all of them. The only difference is that it is far easier to steal from content creators than service providers.\nSo please correct everyone you see making that arguement. The fact that copying the music costs nothing really doesn't matter. It comes down to dividing the fixed costs by a certain amount of customers, or there simply won't be content creators anymore. Maybe the songs need to be 2 cents each, I don't know, but the fact is there are high fixed costs and they need to be covered somehow by someone. The lack of marginal cost just doesn't matter.","completion":"I agree with all of this, but what bothers me is that the record industry is using a form of reverse pie fallacy in which they claim that they would have had X amount of sales, if only those darned pirates hadn't stolen the music.

They do not know that they would have sold X albums if it weren't for pirates. Furthermore, if a person pirates an album, it does not mean that they would have bought it if they couldn't pirate it or if they were more ethical.\nThe people I know who horde large amounts of music do it exactly because it doesn't cost them - if they had to pay for it they simply wouldn't have even close to that much music.

Fuck bad code, micromanagers, dopey \"startups\" that expect 14-hour days on the assumption that 0.0x equity slices represent real \"ownership\", closed allocation, and regimes in which programmers don't choose their tools. All of that can go to hell.\nAs software engineers, we're a defeated tribe. We work for businessmen, get little respect in comparison to the value we add, and often are pigeonholed into roles that are 3 levels below our creative and intellectual ability. We do most of our work for managers and investors who think we're losers because we don't have their jobs.\nTo me, quitting programming is just running away. Programming was never the problem. We need to take control of this game. We need to take it back and make it good-- and fast.","completion":"I would agree with you to a certain extent.

{"prompt":"People really just don't seem to understand that experiences with social media are specific to the individual. I guess it's understandable. I see the same Google Maps as everyone else does. I see the same Hacker News as everyone else who visits HN.\nBut Facebook isn't like that. Your Facebook timeline is based entirely on your friends and how you interact with Facebook.\nAnd so, every few weeks it seems, we get these posts from some techie who believes that his (it's always a man) experiences with social media are universal.\nIt just ain't so. This may be a pat little summary of why using Facebook is unrewarding for the author, but to generalize that to a \"failed\" experiment for everyone, would require talking to other humans about how they experience Facebook \u2014 i.e., doing actual research.

{"prompt":"I think the people who answered wrongly aren't thinking in a first principles, physics-based mindset, but just instead just recalling previous memories and reasoning in an intuitive, fuzzy kind of pattern-matching.\nWe've all seen images of pens floating weightless in space on films and TV, and we probably haven't ever seen pens falling on the moon. But the moon is in space right? so... yeah, why not, it floats.\nAnd for the guys on the moon, well I haven't got any memories of astronauts without boots on, and those boots sure look big and heavy, they're special gravity boots, I'm sure I heard that on TV once, yeah, that's probably it.\nThe first principles approach of applying the concept of universal gravitational attraction probably isn't even entering their heads, even if they've been taught it.\nThis used to get on my nerves, how can people be so stupid? Why won't they just think for a moment!? But recently I've been focussing some effort on learning a language (Spanish) and realise that in that this case the first-principles style of learning that works so well for physics and maths is largely useless, and it's better to turn off the analytical side of your brain and not think too much, just keep exposing yourself, trying to communicate, and let your subconscious do it's stupid fuzzy pattern-matching, and it does a remarkably good job!","completion":"I'm still astonished at this idea though.

{"prompt":"Why don't these people just move to more affordable places?","completion":"Why don't these people just move to more affordable places?\nIn many cases, they are: most often to Sunbelt cities like Dallas, Houston, and Phoenix, which are the fastest growing in percentage terms in the nation (See Matt Yglesias at http:\/\/www.slate.com\/blogs\/moneybox\/2012\/06\/14\/in_the_future... or http:\/\/www.slate.com\/blogs\/moneybox\/2013\/05\/23\/fastest_growi...).\nYglesias also details some of this in The Rent Is Too Damn High (http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0078XGJXO?ie=UTF8&tag=thstsst-20&l... -- a must read on these issues, and I usually post a link when discussions like this one arise).\nAnyway, lots of cities have dysfunctional political and legal systems that prevent the supply of housing from growing. San Francisco's problems are particularly acute: http:\/\/www.citylab.com\/housing\/2013\/10\/san-francisco-exodus\/... and are exacerbated by rent control, which discourages owners from even utilizing existing space."}
{"prompt":"Wow, as someone who is going to start doing Computer Science next year, I had already heard that most of programming is about thinking, but had no idea that is was to the point of 5 lines of code per day being exceptional.","completion":"For me, lines of code per day varies depending on what is being done and how.\nIf it's a meaty problem that is not well understood, or a language or framework I'm unfamiliar with, or I sense the situation is complex enough that an early bad decision could lead to unforeseen troubles later (and I should tread carefully), very few or no lines are written during the day.\nOn the other hand, if it is similar to a thing I have done many times before, and I'm comfortable with the problem, the language and framework then there is much less time thinking and StackOverflowing and I can go at nearly typing speed. (Likewise, if the code is quick \"one of\" type things for tests or throwaway stuff). More than several hundred lines of code a day (JS or Python) in cases like these is very achievable.\nThis doesn't count things like html templates, css etc (although sometime that take a bit of thought as well)."}
{"prompt":"Technological progress should cause increasing economic inequality, because the bottom end of the scale is firmly anchored at zero (someone taking a vacation), while technology gives the top end ever more powerful levers.\nSo the interesting question is not why economic inequality is increasing, but why for a few decades in the mid twentieth century the trend was reversed.\nThere are probably several factors at work here, but as someone who was around and paying attention at the end of that period, I think the key to the answer is the large corporation.  The period of flattening coincides with the heyday of the large corporation.\nLarge corporations tend to decrease economic inequality. You can't measure individual productivity well within large organizations, and even if you could, it would strain the fabric of the organization to reward people that way.  They also hide a lot of inequality by giving elite employees benefits that don't show up in their salaries (http:\/\/paulgraham.com\/ladder.html).\nWhat happened at the end of the 1970s was that the most ambitious people started to lose interest in working their way up the corporate ladder.  They wanted to get paid upfront.  That was why the term \"yuppie\" was born then.  Before 1980 it was rare to find young professionals with lots of money.  In the old days, they were all still paying their dues at that age.\nI remember the transition quite clearly.  When I was a little kid, in the early 70s, the most impressive thing you could do was to work for a large corporation.  It was the era of conglomerates in shiny office towers.  By 1980 we were starting to see a glimpse of the world we now live in, where the ambitious people are all free agents.","completion":"It is far from certain that technological progress was the cause of the increase in inequality. There has been much study on this question--why inequality--and the results are inconclusive. Unfortunately, I don't have the links to back it up right now, but I suggest that you look into the academic literature before coming to a conclusion on the cause of increasing inequality."}

{"prompt":"The news media keeps saying that Borders is going out of business in large part due to e-books.  But I have a hard time buying that.\nI got a kindle six weeks ago and I love it.  I think I've made one purchase and it as $2.50 for scrabble from EA games.  I have yet to buy a book, but I've been reading a lot of the free books on it.  I have a hard time spending a lot of money on ebooks though.  The local library is too good.  I realize that due to my cheap-skatedness I'm probably an anomaly...\nInterestingly, a close family member works for a local used and new bookseller with a nearly 100 year history.  They have struggled mightily in the last 5 years or so, and now are unable to get a loan from any major bank because the bankers say e-books are going to put all bookstores out of business.\nHas anybody _exclusively_ begun using ebooks?  I think amazon's real-world bookselling are a much bigger threat to the likes of borders and the local bookstore than it's e-books are, but maybe I'm just smoking crack.","completion":"I think it's ridiculous to assume that all physical books are worthless. There are reasons to prefer physical books, after all; they're easy to carry around, they don't run out of battery or need any maintenance like charging, and they're generally much cheaper than an e-Reader. If you're not a heavy reader, and not many are these days, why would you spend $150 on a book-reading device? You still have buy the books you would buy anyway, and you have much more freedom buying individual books. e-Books may take a cut out of printed books, but I sincerely doubt they'll obliterate them entirely.\nOn top of all that, used book stores provide much more value than big commercial vendors like B&N because their selection is so broad and so cheap. Used books are in general perfectly fine to be re-read, so people seeking bargains on new books go there frequently; e-Books will generally not be discounted very quickly, there is no such thing as a \"used e-Book\".\nThe _real_ reason used bookstores are going to be around for a long time, though, is that there are A LOT of books out there. Even if someone was able to digitize millions of books, there'd be millions and millions more that would only be able to be found in used bookstores, especially with older books. Just go into your local used book store and ask yourself how much of that catalog is available on the Kindle, or will be made available any time in the foreseeable future. It's a pretty small percentage."}

The last time TrueCrypt was updated was two years ago - it's stable software that doesn't need constant tweaking, so the developers bowing out is not a problem.\nChances are, someone will either fork TrueCrypt (version 3.1 of the TrueCrypt license seems to make this a legitimate possiblity) or create a replacement, possibly using the same container format. TrueCrypt is pretty much just as good as it was before this happened.

{"prompt":"Couldn't agree more. If the behaviour or outcome of a function depends on the current time, then the current time is an input to that function. Inputs to functions should be declared explicitly as arguments where possible.\nThe existence of Time.now and the fact that it's possible to stub this method are not in themselves a good enough justification for excluding the current time from the list of explicit inputs. The length of the list of a function's inputs is one of the indicators of whether a function has too many disparate inputs and therefore too many responsibilities. Obscuring this number is likely to lead to more cluttered code.\nIn DHH's example, Time.now should be called somewhere higher up the call stack where its return value doesn't matter to the outcome of the function in which it resides. It should look like this:\n    def publish!(time)\n      self.update published_at: time\n    end\n\nThat way the inputs are clear. It also happens to mean that you can test it without requiring the linguistic flexibility provided by Ruby, but that doesn't mean that testability in inflexible languages is the only reason why it's the right thing to do.","completion":"Regarding the 'publish!' method, the post linked to in DHH's example (http:\/\/weblog.therealadam.com\/2013\/01\/03\/design-for-test-vs-...) explains this as a 'trade off' - the summary of the other side being that if you don't pass 'time' to it you get a simper API.\nThis is somewhat more nuanced than your and DHH's conflicting opinions, and perhaps I show my inexperience (as primarily a ruby programmer), but this seems very sensible to me. It also reasonably describes why DHH's opinions may differ from others because of the focus of his work (in addition to the language used)."}

I think Clojure assumes you already know lisp, quote, unquote, syntax trees, defs, vars, etc...\n(4) it's full of magic. You can feel it, but you can't really understand it without digging through the source code.\nI know OCaml, can read Haskell, and wrote a small library in closure. I still find it very hard do get around and very hard to learn.","completion":"Clojure is already successful for many people.  What you probably meant to say is that Clojure will never be mainstream.  That's probably true, but I have been subscribed to the clojure mailing list for quite a while now and actually quite surprised how much Clojure code is in production.\nThat said, the two big \"strikes\" against clojure for \"mainstream\" adoption are as you pointed out, it's a Lisp, and it's dynamically typed.\nI like the core concepts of Clojure.  That there are a small set of primitives that have a uniform interface and how Clojure is anti-OO.  Clojure actually does OO better than OO languages do, but that's another story.\nIf I could just get a Clojure with some optional typing, a python-like syntax, and awesome tools, I'd be a happy camper."}

{"prompt":"I find his point about \"overstaying your welcome\" to be of significance. What constitutes such an intrusion? Is there some sort of universal time limit? Is it commensurate with the amount of money one spends?\nI've always operated by the tenet that, if they take my money, I am justified in staying for as for long as is necessary. This seems to be the generally accepted precedent, as I've seen an immeasurable number of people purchase a single item and spend an entire day working. This is especially true of local, boutique coffee shops, at which the patrons seem to be less transient than those of, say, a Starbucks. Personally, I generally purchase a single espresso for $1.50, add milk to attempt to simulate the taste of an actual cappuccino (at one third of the cost), and stay for between three and six hours.

They pay people pennies an hour to do those things for you. You can just pay them to do them, and do interesting, hard things yourself.\nPersonally, I think preferring easy things to hard things is a sign of weakness. Doing hard things is fulfilling. Cash is incidental, but it is a very good metric of how hard something is. If you are not making very much money, you aren't doing things that are very hard.\nLife is, truly, very short.

{"prompt":"I understand the point the article is trying to make, but its not realistic. Having worked with the Navy for a few years I know that the biggest use of airplanes is not air to air combat ( which is what this article is complaining about ) It is air to land bombing. So why are we complaining about making an air force that serves our needs rather then one that might be useful for some other task.\nAs a note he says this will be the \"new mainstay of the air force\" however we still have the F-22 as our air superiority fighter which is still believed to be better then anything out there, and indeed in their simulation the only limitation to the F-22 was there were too few of them. So this isn't really about America losing air superiority its about a few analysts not taking into account the entire mission of the three branches of the military. Maybe this plane doesn't stack up well against the F-16 or F-22, but It sure beats the Harrier and the F-18.","completion":"Won't the air to ground bombing mission be done mostly by drones?

How much time can kids really spend learning everyday? A few hours at the most?\nI have a friend who teaches 1st grade, she knows kids at that age can't spend time on focused learning for more than 20 or 30 minutes, but the school districts forces here to teach in 1 to 2 hour blocks and spend almost 6 hours out of the day instructing\n(they get 15 minutes, no more, of recess; 30 minutes lunch, many times in silence because the lunchroom gets too loud;  and on some days 45 minutes of focused PE).\nWhat 6 or 7 year old can possibly sit still and study for 5 or 6 hours each day?","completion":"Most schools in America do little more than condition children to the 40 hour work week + homework\/overtime.

Then when the bulb goes out, you can just unscrew the LEDs without having to throw away all the other components.\nMaybe there's something I'm missing though; I am by no means knowledgable about electronics.","completion":"This is possible, but the features would be limited to only on\/off and basic dimming."}

{"prompt":"Generating and caching are orthogonal questions.  You can generate stuff, and then cache it.  And in fact HN does do a lot of caching.\nI wasn't asking how much faster \"semantically correct markup\" would make HN pages render as a rhetorical question.  I'm genuinely curious.  If you want to make claims that x is faster than y, you should be prepared to back them up with numbers, not merely with more heated language.","completion":"Generating and caching can be intertwined. For example, HN seems to generate an inline script at the top of every page. The script doesn't change nearly as often as the posts do, so that script is sent redundantly at the top of every page. If that script were located at separate URL, set to expire never, every visitor would load it once and never again. If you need to change the script, you can change the linked URL. Doing that can avoid an expensive calculation for the server, but also a network request for the client which could be very, very expensive.\nTo me, it sounds like the caching you're talking about is on the server side. I think you mean something similar to memoization, so you can avoid doing some expensive query or calculation. That is worth doing, but it's still possible to organize the output of those caches in an inefficient manner, and incur unnecessary network overhead. The \"semantically correct\" part of the markup being advocated here isn't that interesting, if you ask me. What is interesting is the claim is that you can generate less markup per page, and get the same display.\nThe balance between the repeat visitor cache behavior and the initial number of HTTP requests and latency for a first-time visitor can get hard to judge. Without lots of time to measure the various alternatives and mitigation tactics, it's best to try and generates as little markup as possible. That's where so-called \"semantic markup\" comes in. Usually it's just less markup, and does better.\nAnother thing to take into account is the layout behavior triggered in various browsers by the markup you're generating. HN is pretty simple and should render instantly, but it doesn't in anything I've tested (Firefox, Chrome, Safari). Each of them redraw the scrollbar one or more times. That could be due to the tables."}

{"prompt":"Just about every pro sports league needs to manage its rules to ensure that the playing field gets leveled every season. For example, NFL draft picks are in reverse order of season success. If last year's Super Bowl winner was able to choose their next team on a completely free market, they would simply use their boosted revenue and pay the most for the best players, thus making it much more likely that they'll increase their domination. No one wants to watch a dominating team shut out clearly inferior teams game after game.\nF1 needs rules to tighten gaps between the team and to prevent one team from spending their way to success. I think we can argue about whether the new power units, DRS, and tire management are the right way to do this, but I'm glad they're trying something.","completion":"Outside of America there are far more sports that don't try to even the playing field artificially.

{"prompt":"The two examples most familiar to me are the Jean Valjean scenario (stealing for survival) and the Jack Bauer scenario (coercion or torture to save lives).\nIn both cases, there's an argument that the underlying activity (theft, torture) should remain illegal. It would be difficult or impossible to codify all the permissible extenuating circumstances, and leaving the question open-ended and letting it be decided in court would be a disaster, much worse than existing carve-outs like self defense as an excuse for homicide (which is itself kind of a mess, legally).\nCertain dour strains of penal theory would argue that the 'virtuous criminal' still requires equal punishment (Chinese legalism, for example), but I think the more popular stance in the modern day is that judges and state executives (governors, presidents) should have the option of leniency. This takes the fate of Jean Valjean outside the sphere of law and exposes it to popular opinion -- an unreasonable act of clemency would be faced with blowback (just ask Mike Huckabee).","completion":"...the Jack Bauer scenario...\nI find 24 to be much more interesting when I view Bauer as a second villain, rather than the unquestionable hero as it seems he's portrayed."}

If I live in the countryside, and have an hourly bus or even twice daily bus, then that's both a maximum time to wait, and a schedule I can plan on, while Uber for that case will be highly variable and therefore difficult to plan around.\nOther issues are only specific to the Uber case. If there are no personal vehicles then there's no need to worry about teen drivers with a sunset driving curfew or people with a restraining order who are nevertheless obligated to pick up a passenger.\nI am hard pressed to think of a future where \"society might no have a choice\", but where your proposal makes any sense."}

Say you're a Ruby developer, but you know a lot about CPA, ARPU, LTV, churn, and other terms SaaS types care a lot about.\nYes, you might cost significantly more per week than a peer Ruby developer who might be employed by a prospective client of yours, but the cost of getting that employee's knowledge to around where yours is outweighs the difference.\nAdditionally, clients want to lower the risk that a project will fail (note: this doesn't mean technically fail, as in the code doesn't work.)

Also, as your client has lower perception of project risk and execution risk, their perception of the probable magnitude of the success for your engagement will likely increase.

Somehow I have trouble imagining stories of Jeff Foxworthy, a famous white man with a 'redneck' stereotype, being arrested \"for having guns in his car\" being passed around with the same tone of smug judgement.\n- Don't forget the history of racist double standards when it came to black gun ownership in America, both recent and (comparatively) ancient.

Maybe it's foolish of me, but let me try to illustrate with a more extreme example.\nSuppose a black man was to commit some heinous crime, and we had irrefutable proof he was completely guilty (just suppose, bear with me).  Normally, he'd be tried and put away.  But what if this black man's defense was 'well, I was being profiled- if it wasn't for the stereotype that blacks are more violent and commit more crimes, I wouldn't have been caught so clearly this is unfair. I should go free.'\nIMHO, you can file complaints and suits and get all the damages you like for being unfairly profiled, and I'll generally back you up, but as soon as you're guilty of what they profiled you for, you loose all my support and earn my disgust.  He may be right, maybe through racism we catch more guilty blacks than whites or something, but either way the hypothetical man is guilty.  The way to fix that flaw is not let him go but start catching the whites too.\nre: double standards and corrupt law enforcement, I'll give you that."}

The former of course is something like a reference count and a pointer to a string elsewhere; the latter would have some overhead when strings are of varying lengths.  If memory usage were really a concern, decent savings could be realized by changing (most of?) the 13 float64 columns to float32, and some of the object (string) columns to fixed-width.  For example, \"lang\" is two characters always, and usernames (which are stored in several fields) would be more efficiently stored as char[15].

The idea is to wear a bracelet, and never complain.  If you complain, you must change the bracelet to the other arm.  The goal is to go for 30 days straight without complaining.  It\u2019s surprisingly hard to do.  At first I thought it was stupid, because it\u2019s what going on inside your brain that counts, and not giving it voice surely wouldn\u2019t make any difference.  But I found that it makes a huge difference.  The act of not complaining, never complaining, retrains your brain to think about what you truly are in control of, and what you are not in control of.  It helps translate hardship into either actively making the situation better, or not thinking about it.  That\u2019s really all anyone can ever do, but having the option to complain makes that a lot cloudier.  Going the full 30 days without complaining, I\u2019ve learned, cannot be done without totally retraining the mind to see life differently.

Tesla uses this system to monitor various vehicle metrics including the battery charge levels, as long as the vehicle has the GSM connection activated4 and is within range of AT&T\u2019s network. According to the Tesla service manager, Tesla has used this information on multiple occasions to proactively telephone customers to warn them when their Roadster\u2019s battery was dangerously low.\nIn at least one case, Tesla went even further.

{"prompt":"The algorithm is not targeted against the type of password which the XKCD comic suggests. The algorithm is designed to exploit common human behavior, which is similar to the XKCD method but not identical. The significant difference is that human behavior in picking words is not random, while the XKCD method requires the word selection process to be truly random. The \"iloveyousomuch\" example by Steube is unlikely to be picked randomly.\nsalmonellaeater is right, Steube misunderstands the comic. The idea of the comic is to pick a small random selection of the 250,000 distinct words in a oxford dictionary, rather than 8 of the 95 letters from all ASCII printable characters. A selection of 3 words has then higher entropy than 8 random characters, because 250,000^3 is a bigger number than 95^8. The question then is, will 3 random words really be easier to remember than 8 ASCII printable characters?\nThe downside to the Schneier scheme, is that each is a common sentence (low entropy), with a chosen transformation algorithm added. Thus the quality of the password will depend on the number of transformation algorithms, and the quality of each one. If we are to use the one first described to create \"tlpWENT2m\", we get a password strength like:\nUsing strictly the first letter, would only do 2x linear increase in entropy over just searching for common sentences. Change any occurrence of common numbers substitutes for words adds (0-2x) entropy increase. Writing one of the words in all caps means 6x increase in entropy.

Let's say that by policy the background data store (e.g. MySQL) always has a copy that is at most 10 minutes old. In practice it could probably be much more recent. So in general user data is safe but you want something very simple to prevent data loss and service disruption in the most common failure scenarios.\nI believe the best paradigm is a replication buddy system between two given Nodes. Should a Node instance fail, the app can always issue the same request to its \"replication buddy\" and expect to get the same data. Implementing a replication buddy relationship between two instances should be relatively easy using a persistent connection between them, since Node is all non-blocking but still guaranteed sequentially executed code (=there will be no real consistency problem). Nodes could just notify each other when data changes in the background and they'd both always have the same data state. Granted, there would have to be some code to take care of what happens in different failure modes (probably the most complex aspect of the whole thing), but overall still very doable.\nScaling would be even easier: just put user IDs into different buckets, each bucket is a replicated instance. If this is even necessary.\nAnd the beauty of it is that you have to implement this just once, no matter how many different server-side apps and languages you use. It would be a common piece of infrastructure."}

{"prompt":"A factor I think the article doesn't point out clearly enough is how the main attraction of dissing code is that it serves as an ego-defense mechanism. Understanding code is, almost without exception, challenging. It's much easier on our self image if we believe the code is to blame, rather than us.\nAn unfortunate side effect is that this perceived badness of the code is then often used as an excuse to not really try and understand it at all (\"let's rewrite!\" or \"we don't touch that anymore\").","completion":"A good assessment in my opinion.\nAs a junior coder earlier in my career I found exactly the situation described.  A co-worker was always griping loudly about how bad the code and architectural decisions of certain people supposedly were - all except his own, of course.\nAt first I was too diffident to form an opinion and considered whether he might be right.  When I gained more experience, and finally got a look at what he was ranting about, it seemed to me that this guy's targets were not so bad and that his own output was hardly more impressive.\nEventually I saw other examples of this pattern and realized something: those who bluster in this way tend to be middle-range developers who are trying to cover up their own insecurities - while those who are really superior tend to be quieter, more businesslike and basically getting things done, and well, while those described above are going on in their \"BS\" sessions.\nI don't claim to qualify for the latter group to the degree I would like, but when I hear the denigration, I ask what are the specific problems and what do we propose to do about them. And I try to promote a positive atmosphere, and really learn the code rather than just looking for where to put more duct tape."}

{"prompt":"Thanks for the feedback!\nYes, will definitely need to do a better job explaining how grouping works (and perhaps also fine-tune how it actually does work). Currently the time setting (e.g. the default 10 minutes) is the time threshold between successive edits for grouping edits together. Note that this only affects grouping while the table is loading, it does not update existing groups. The \"Group\" button groups the whole selection together, while the \"Ungroup\" button shatters the whole selection into individual atomic edits. It's a bit complicated and could definitely need some work still, but I feel something similar to this is needed to provide an easy default overview of edits but also allow users to fine-tune to view the exact diffs that they wish to see. Any further suggestions here would be more than welcome.\nIgnoring certain filenames based on regexp is coming soon, probably already in 1.2.1, within a week or two. (This has been suggested by several users.)\nWith regards to diff viewers: I'm trying to offload diffs to existing software. Currently, all the supported diff viewers cost money, so am definitely looking into connecting with existing free apps as soon as possible. There is at least Apple's FileMerge (though it is cumbersome to obtain since it only comes as part of Xcode), other suggestions are welcome! I'll look into integrating Mergely as well.\nFinally, will definitely be adding the ability to purchase the premium version outside of the Mac App Store. I'm not a big fan of the store myself. (I'm trying to combat some of the existing problems of the store by having separate web download versions that can read the App Store receipt.

Sample script for FileMerge provided.\nCorrecting my earlier post, actually TextWrangler (one of the natively supported diff apps) is free of charge, and now with the custom diff script users can connect to other free diff apps as well (such as FileMerge).\nWill soon be adding the possibility to purchase Premium functionality outside the Mac App Store, probably within a week or so."}

{"prompt":"From the email thread, it sounds like the decision to shard on UID was made mostly to increase locality of data, so that you didn't have to query more than one node to get a single user's data.\nThere's no silver bullet here. Hashing on insertion order would basically guarantee that writes would favor one node over another, which random hashes would force you to aggregate results from all available nodes for each query.","completion":"This stuff can be very counter intuitive. Locality may not be what you want.\nFor example, last I heard google's search index was sharded by document rather than by term.\nThat sounds odd, since if it was sharded by term, then a given search would only need to go to a handful of servers (one for each term) and then the intermediate result combined. But with it sharded by document, every query has to go to all the nodes in each replica\/cluster.\nIt ends up that's not as bad as it seems. Since everything is in ram, they can answer \"no matches\" on a given node extremely quickly (using bloom filters mostly in on processor cache or the like). They also only send back truly matching results, rather than intermediates that might be discarded later, saving cluster bandwidth. Lastly it means their search processing is independent of the cluster communication, giving them a lot of flexibility to tweak the code without structural changes to their network, etc.\nDoes that mean everyone doing search should shard the same way? Probably not. You have to design this stuff carefully and mind the details. Using any given data store is not a silver bullet."}

Basically, courts will be unwilling to reduce damages if infringer argues that he\/she didn't know the work was copyrighted.\nAlso, in the U.S. under federal law, copyright isn't granted upon creation of a work but rather upon its fixation.  So thinking up a poem and speaking it isn't enough; you actually need to write it down or record it.","completion":"I wonder what happens in this case:\n1. You think up a new poem, and speak it at open mic night at a club. No one is recording, so there is no fixation.\n2. Someone else hears your poem, goes home, and writes it down from memory. That's not fixation, since 17 USC 101 defines one of the elements of fixation as being by or under the authority of the author. So, the work is still not fixed, so copyright has not yet attached.\n3. That person starts making and selling copies of your poem.\n4. You finally write down your poem. It's now fixed, and copyright attaches.\nI would presume that you can now stop that other person, via copyright law, from making any more copies. Is there any case, though, for damages from the copies that were made and sold before #4? Can you prevent the distribution of the copies #3 has already made by not sold? Can you prevent the people who have bought copies already from reselling them, or does first sale apply?

{"prompt":">modifying a large collection, at the moment, can trigger the entire collection to re-render which can be extremely expensive.\nHow large is large enough to cause problems?","completion":"It really depends on your environment and the complexity of the rendering tied to your collection.  For example, on a fast desktop-class system with a collection that renders one element with 1 property, you can probably have hundreds (or maybe even thousands) of items in the collection before you start to notice slowdowns when the collections update. Working on lower-end and mobile platforms, those numbers change. Similarly, if you rendering is complex, it will take more time as well.   All that said, there's really no \"magic number\"\nThere are definite workarounds such as setting up paging--but the simple approach of using Ember.js bindings to bind a collection to a template will fall to pieces as that collection grows."}

I don't know anything beyond the most basic characteristics of Haskell, so I can't really comment further.","completion":"Obviously there are some differences, but type classes are pretty similar to the way python normally works - type classes specify methods that a type has to have. So in the case of 'print', the type specifies that print can be called on anything that implements the method that turns a value into a string. The neat thing, of course, is that if you try to call it on something that doesn't implement that method, you get a compile error (and with proper tooling, I actually see red squiggles in my editor if I make this mistake, which is about as good as it can get)."}

He lays down an argument that most people have a strong, instinctual resistance to killing. In WWI, only about 20% on the front lines even fired their weapons. That rose during WWII and Korea until during Vietnam, it was closer to 95%. He attributes the change to modern training methods which are basically operant conditioning.\n(He also has fascinating interviews with veterans about their experiences.

{"prompt":"Fowler has a habit of inventing \"special terms\" for what people have long considered \"programming\", and people get sucked into some fundamentalism. I don't like how the author of this article appeals to authority when trying to justify the use of a service locator over DI.\n> So if Martin Fowler says that it is possible to use a service locator instead of DI in unit testing, then who are you to argue otherwise?\nThis argument is the same as \"It is possible to use a global variable instead of an argument when unit testing a procedure.\" That's really what a service locator is - a facade around global variables, unless of course, you use DI to inject the service locator, then you've not really gained anything, but just inserted another layer of indirection.\nAnd that brings us back to why we even use techniques which are now labeled \"DI\" in the first place - they're basically there to avoid the use of globals (and hence, tight coupling). Interfaces are in place to keep implementations decoupled while providing everything necessary for them to interact.","completion":"> So if Martin Fowler says that it is possible to use a service locator instead of DI in unit testing, then who are you to argue otherwise?\nThere are good arguments against a service locator - one of them is presented here:\nhttp:\/\/blog.ploeh.dk\/2010\/02\/03\/ServiceLocatorisanAnti-Patte...\nAnother argument again the service locator pattern is this: If you ask the locator for a service which has dependencies you have to resolve those dependencies yourself. So you need to know about the specific implemntation of this service interface which defeats the purpse. If you work around that, you end up with something that is pretty close to a DI container."}

Surprised not to see Songkick on there, considering a) they're YC-funded, b) they're looking for rails hackers atm.\n3) Clicking on the map brought me to the company description (I suppose because i had to browse by company to drill down to London), and i had to find a link on the right hand side to figure out what the job was. If there's only one job opening, it should really be displayed too, surely?\n4) Interestingly, I clicked on the \"Head of engineering\" job for Covestor, and was surprised to find that although the company is in NY, the job is in central London... Why wasn't it on the map?\nI think it would really help your traction with international users to:\n1) Make it easy to drill down by geography.\n2) Allow jobs to be attached to locations, not just companies\n3) Make a guess at determining the visitor's country (very easy with libraries like GeoIP) and automatically drill down to their country by default.\nHope this helps.","completion":"Thanks for the feedback! (All of it)\nA couple things that I hope will help:\n- To search a location, use the modifier \"in\". So, the search [in London] will parse jobs that have London in their location field (we have a pretty good amount of structured data).\n- Right now, the map only shows company \"headquarters.\" Many startups have multiple offices; to post a job in a different location, they first create a new branch in their profile (structure), and then assign that location when they create the posting.

I was reading the interview with Steve Wozniak in Founders at Work, and what most struck me was how he talked about Apple's biggest innovations as being things either he or Steve Jobs made for themselves, because they wanted their computers to be better.\nThe guys at 37signals made their products so that they could use them. Mark Zuckerberg made Facebook for himself and friends. I'd imagine the thought process was something similar at Google.","completion":"The best creations are the ones inventors are making for themselves.\nI agree with this, and this is something many successful entrepreneurs have said. But here's the dilemma I was pointing out (maybe not so clearly) in my previous comment: After your initial success, when your customers clearly want you to add widgets A, B and C but you want to work on innovative product Z instead, it takes a visionary and gutsy person to do that. I realize that there isn't always such a clear cut binary choice.\nWhile it might not be an either-or proposition, many if not most entrepreneurs find their interests diverging from that of the business after initial success. If you're acquired, this is almost guaranteed.\n37 signals, Facebook and Google all have one thing in common: the founders are still in control but it's hard to argue that Google still builds what Larry and Sergey want to build for themselves. At best, Google now builds what its employees want to make for themselves. I can assure you that day to day, Larry and Sergei's jobs look very different from their jobs in 1998."}

{"prompt":"Consider programmers that you respect; why do you respect them?\nThe expertise and dedication that I consider respect-worthy have not been deemed so by others.\nmost people don't just set out to be a respectable person in the abstract; they work to excel at particular things in their life.\nAgain, you assume a meritocracy in which those who excel are appropriately rewarded. In my experience of the corporate world the rewards are distributed according to a different set of rules and I would like to understand them so as to be better served by them.\nYour assumption here is that I did nothing to deserve respect but expect it to be delivered free of charge.

{"prompt":"I'll try lay-mans this for you. Time doesn't really slow down.\nYou have a reference frame, your reference frame simply describes something along the lines of \"where you are\". \"Where you are\" could be how close you are to something massive (a star, a planet) or how fast you are moving.\nIf you have a watch on your own wrist it will always tick at 1 second from your own perspective (ignoring extreme cases like black holes, where your hand could be in a very different reference frame from your face). It will always be correct and time will never slow down or speed up. It will be exactly the same 1 second that everyone in the universe experiences from their own perspective. However, if someone looked at your watch with a telescope from another reference frame it would be ticking faster or slower than their own watch.\nThis is where relativity gets its name from \"something in RELATION to another.\" Without checking your relation to something else you can't determine that time flows at different rates.\nThink of time as a smooth river. The further along the river you are the more time you have experienced (our classical notion of time does not exist, it has been replaced by distance). If you move into the area of the river that has a strong current you will move through the river faster but from your own perspective the water and people directly around you will still be the same. You would only be able to tell that you are in a strong current if you could see someone who is in the weaker current.\nTherefore our clocks do exactly what they should be doing, measuring 1 second by ways of our own frame of reference.","completion":"Yep, this was the most difficult thing to grasp when I started learning this stuff. I thought that somehow the body knows to slow things down when it is in motion. But when you think through it, it is easy. Its all in the reference frames. Imagine yourself going from Earth to Alpha Centauri in a constant velocity. In SR terms, this means you are in motion with respect to earth. Now imagine there is nothing else in the universe except you. Take away Earth, Alpha Centauri, all stars, galaxies, etc. Nothing but infinite empty space. Imagine yourself doing the same movement (I know it is a stretch and I am butchering physics here, since I asked to take away your source and destination, but you can form a mental picture). Now, in SR terms, I cannot say anything about your motion. You are neither moving nor stationary and it is pointless to say anything. But based on old Newtonian model, you can be considered \"moving\" in this big empty room of Universe (which later became theorized into Ether). When you grasp this and understand that motion is relative, also understand that time is relative. There is no giant universal clock which dictates what time it is for this giant room (which is again what Newton imagined). Einstein simply said there is no such thing (aka special reference frame). Once this is grasped, other concepts like time dilation will flow from it."}
{"prompt":"Everyone that says this doesn't know how hard it was to get back then. I started looking for a way to buy it when it was at a buck fifty, and it took me until it was at four dollars before I finally was able to do the transaction (in cash in person at a cafe in Toronto with a off-grid cryptoanarchist).\nThe easiest way back then was to try to figure out how to install the GPU miner and then just hope that the block difficulty did spike because everyone else was doing the same thing.

I put the first one on about 10% chance of happening and the second one on about 30% chance of happening, so about 3% chance total. If it hits that 3% the maximum I think bitcoin could be worth is about ten million dollars a coin ($10k average purchasing power for a couple billion people). So I made my profit already (on my original bet that it would gain momentum, which it has) and now I'm riding a decently likely (given the payout) lottery ticket.","completion":"Ease of purchase was definitely an issue. When it was $1\/coin there was a guy selling them through PayPal, maximum order size of 20 bitcoins. So I bought 20 because it was easy and it reminded me of some cool Neal Stephenson stories.

It's sort of a \"if you can't beat 'em, join 'em\" strategy: they start getting a cut of this fee from every participating pirate, which is a lot more than they used to get ($0), but a lot less than they wish they could get ($15 per album).","completion":"Here's what I don't understand about your (and a lot of people's, I don't mean to pick on you) comments, please help me understand this:\nPirated files are not necessarily identifiable as such, not in the digital world.

All it does is exchange one set of bits for another set of bits, and this set of bits or that set of bits don't make an audio file legitimate or illegitimate.\nI mean it's a bit like transcoding, isn't it?  Except instead of doing it yourself, you're paying Apple to do it.  The fact that a third party is providing the service doesn't necessarily mean that the process as a whole is legit, in the same way that taking a PDF of a book to FedEx Kinko's to print doesn't make the copy legit, in the same way that buying a Windows upgrade to upgrade your old pirated Windows doesn't make the resulting license legit.\nI realize we're in kind of a special circumstance here because Apple has paid the music labels a lot of money, but we're just speculating about what the contents of their license enables them to do, which is probably only to be indemnified in the event that people use the service with pirated music (but not to indemnify the actual users).\nOr am I missing something?"}

{"prompt":"I should clarify that what I described in my post took place during adolescence (age 10+), not childhood. The case for restricting screen use during childhood is more clear.\n>It made you get creative, and it forced you to concentrate and maximize your leisure time.\nCreative in coming up with ways to evade authority, perhaps. I was intensely paranoid of my parents discovering me on the computer. It sure was great having my adrenaline spike every half hour or so whenever I heard my mother's footsteps on the stairs. That sort of dynamic is hardly conducive to creative work. Instead, I gravitated towards short-form games, and I mastered the art of Alt-Tabbing. That's how I learned to \"maximize my leisure time.\" I rarely risked playing long-form team-based games with my friends (e.g. StarCraft, DotA) because getting kicked off the computer meant letting my whole team down.\nMy parents did not succeed in reducing the amount of time I spent on the computer. They succeeded only in causing me to associate the computer with feelings of guilt, shame, and resentment; they succeeded in convincing me that there was something wrong with me.\nLook, I'm not a parent, so I am missing some perspective. I understand that parents are people too, with full-time jobs and myriad other responsibilities; they don't always have time to sit down and connect with their kids. Overall, it seems incredibly difficult to instill proper values in a child without also instilling some neuroses along the way. That is why I am able to forgive my parents. But forgiving them does not mean that I agree with their actions. They fell into the old trap -- \"People fear what they do not understand\" -- and their knee-jerk reaction was to treat me like a drug addict, subjecting me to verbal abuse, constant monitoring, and the occasional \"this-time-we're-serious\" intervention. You can do better.","completion":"I was raised catholic, so I hear you on instilled neuroses.\nI think your parents' success lies in their making the screen a finite\/precious resource for you.

Your enemy denies this, proclaims you a tyrant, and endeavors to make war against you. How do you respond?\nOne method undercuts your enemy's message, reaffirms your core values, and has the potential to alter and modify your enemy so that he is predisposed to be united with you.\nThe other affirms his message, strengths his position, and emboldens those who follow him.\nThis leads to the last question: what is your objective? Is it victory, or something else?\nWhat better path to victory then to alter the mind of your enemy until he is incapable of fighting you?\nOur educational assets ought to therefore be shared. To sensor them in the name of security is foolish.","completion":"Neither of the systems or nations involved are keen on liberty, the only difference is one side has redefined what the word means in order to continue using it in elections, while the other outright believes personal freedom is a sign of decadence. At the core both believe in steep authoritarianism. Looking at things from the outside in, both the USA and the ideologies it fights have striking similarities. Both have values centered on abject ignorance and strict religious ideas, both are warlike and hierarchical, both are conservative with strong reactionary tendencies.\nSure, a good argument can be made that a culture based on Islamic fundamentalism is philosophically and ethically much worse than living under the droning malevolence of Christianity, but in reality there's little honor in being second place when both ideologies come with followers who run a big part of the world with money, advanced weapons and technology.\nAnd I agree, one of the few concepts that could offer a way out of this is indeed education, hopefully paving the way for rationalism and humanism."}

So it is certainly a viable alternative.\nIs it the best alternative?\nErlang, as the article states, has some good things going for it; it's better than anything else that I know of for several categories of tasks.  The problem is that other things are catching up, and while they may not be \"as good\", people can and will pick them if they are \"good enough\" and have other qualities that make them a good choice, such as being easier to learn.\nYour comment to me comes across along the same lines of the people thinking digital photography would never surpass the quality of regular film.  Maybe node.js won't be the one to catch up and pass Erlang, but my gut feeling is that something will.  Scala, maybe?"}

{"prompt":"Here is an argument, which I have carefully tailored to the level of the arguments you have advanced:\nDemocracy, augmented with some anti-majoritarian safeguards, is a reasonable way of organizing society on a basis that generally advances overall liberties, and social-contract theory provides a reasonable philosophical basis. Libertarian freedom-of-contract is essentially a right to indentured servitude with only the barest attention paid to anything resembling actual real-world liberty or genuine consent, and only people who are either primitivist hippies living in the woods, or malicious exploiters, promote it as a fundamental good. And also anyone who disagrees with this paragraph is dumb.","completion":"The problem here is that you are choosing your definitions for \"real-world liberty\" and \"genuine consent\", etc.  I guess if your point was only to make a point about the parent post doing the same thing, then, erm.. good job?  But as an argument in it's own right, I don't find this very compelling.\nAnyway, technologue has a point in suggesting that the \"social contract\" is worthy of skepticism.

{"prompt":"Probably because this is just 2D tracking rather than 3D mapping. But tracking can be applied to mapping, for example: http:\/\/www.robots.ox.ac.uk\/~gk\/PTAM\/\nSo the question is, can predator be used to improve mapping? AFAIK, that would require a) automatically selecting trackable objects and b) tracking many of them simultaneously. That PTAM technique tracks thousands, but with tracking this reliable, you might get by with much less.\nSo, more work is required to apply it to mapping, but I have to imagine it could be done.

All I really do is have a fairly casual 20-30 minute conversation with the job candidate about the state of whatever tech the product will be built in - \"what's the quirkiest thing you've found in iOS?\", \"which backend platforms do you like? why that one instead of this one?\", etc. Throw in a question about big O notation if you think this job requires some CS knowledge.\nIt's generally pretty easy to see who can walk the walk, without resorting to grilling candidates with trivia or detailed hypotheticals."}
{"prompt":"The term of art you're looking for is \"specific heat\".\nhttps:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Specific_heat\nThe relevant number for water at 25C is 4.184 joules per gram. But this isn't a strict apples to apples comparison: if you heat and cool zeolite in a vacuum chamber, it'll have a pathetic specific heat. (Like perlite, another foamed mineral, which has a specific heat of something like 0.1) That's because there's a chemical reaction taking place, not pure dumb-matter heating or cooling.\nMeanwhile, the energy density of a lithium ion battery is 720 joules per gram, and the energy density of gasoline is 47,200 joules per gram. This does not \"solve\" energy storage, in any way, shape, or form.","completion":"Someone downmodded you because you messed up your units.\nIt's 4.184 joules per gram Kelvin. Meaning it stores that much energy for each dress of heat you add to it. If you take water from near freezing to boiling that's 100 degrees of storage - meaning 418.4 joules per gram - which is much more reasonable.\nAnd there is no reason you have to stop at boiling. Storing something at 500 degrees is not impractical, so assuming starting at 20 degrees (room temperature) you can store over 2000 joules per gram. And there are plenty of materials that can handle even higher temperatures."}

They matter. People in need of food and shelter are of deep concern to many people. It's good of you to ask such a fundamental question. Social welfare is critical in many areas. However, the means by which it exists is open to great evolution. Peaceful transitions are critical. Increasing the amount of care in the world and increasing the ways with which people can leverage their individual and collective power (not through violent systems) is critical.

{"prompt":"That kind of response starts to sound like \"no true Scotsman\" pretty darn quick.  How do you distinguish between state that is on the stack (which FP still has), state that is on the heap, or state that is on external storage?  Are those the same distinctions\/evasions that I'd get from the next three FP advocates I asked?  I keep hearing about how FP saves us from all that evil mutable state, but every time I look at a program written in a functional language I see plenty of mutable state.  Half of it is entangled with control flow, which I do not see as an unalloyed win.  When that doesn't suffice, those same programs often resort to externalizing their state (e.g. into a database), often incurring a significant and unnecessary performance penalty just so they can give it a name and treat it as something outside of their program.  Aristocrats never like to get their hands dirty, and that's exactly how most FP advocacy comes across.  \"Let them eat monads.\"  Can't wait for the guillotine.","completion":"There are answers to those questions but they do not help you to understand functional programming as a practice. Because you're asking the equivalent of \"But how does OOP distinguish stack from heap from storage?\" and it's not a practical question.\nThe answer is something along the lines of: the compiler is usually very different from most, it uses graph reduction and rewriting techniques, garbage collectors optimized for block reusage for all the heap churn that all those function frames would generate if implemented naively (that's why recursion ends up being as fast as a loop); this is my cursory understanding of it. But yes, I would suggest Lisp in Small Pieces and Appel's compiler books.\nFor practical purposes what is important is that FP is inviting you to program in this world where it is not important to talk about how those things end up getting implemented on the machine. In fact it lets you quickly escape that world whenever possible by allowing you to alias the String type to FirstName for instance; so you can talk about the problem you're trying to solve, and not the computer that will run it. That's the point of declarative programming and FP is declarative.\nIt's the same in Prolog, I'd think. I'm sure they don't care about how these things are actually being created and destroyed on the machine; the power of Prolog's declarative style is precisely that it allows you to never talk about the machine if you don't want to. That ends up being more general than the usual abstractions of the day that still model themselves after the turing machine.\nThere's no state to speak of. FP builds the blueprint of the program (one level removed from the way OOP and procedural see things) and gives it to the computer to run it. Now we make the execution order implicit (it's now implicitly threaded through the functions' caller-callee relationships) and we lose the ability to do state (because state depends on ordering things, which can be represented by the semicolon in curly-brace languages). We also lose the ability to do one thing after the other. But although it sounds like a bad thing, it's actually a really good thing, because apparently most bugs live inside semicolons."}

I spoke with one sysadmin who told me that even if 100% of the developers were using git-svn he would never allow git as the official location to store code on the servers and it must be pushed back to svn.  I am not sure how to respond to people like that.\nEdit: When pressed for more details it was clear that he was happy with his svn server setup and didn't want to change and have to learn something new.  This was not a logical discussion, but an emotional one and as he ran the servers he had the final say."}

{"prompt":"I am not 100% sure in how they work either (haven't programmed C for 4 years), so I just avoid these kind of unnecessary complications in the code\nHear, hear.  I am considered the \"language lawyer\" of my embedded group and often get asked questions about C minuti\u00e6.  It isn't uncommon that my answer is \"I don't know how that works, because I would never write something that requires an answer to that\".\nModern compilers are blind to shorthands etc.; the only useful knowledge about \"C\" (really C compiler & hardware) minuti\u00e6 relates to (a) how to convince the compiler to optimize certain high-level constructs (e.g. loop unrolling), (b) how to convince the compiler to emit certain low-level constructs (e.g. SIMD instructions), and (c) how the hardware behaves (e.g. the cache model).  Generally anything else \u2013 you can rewrite it so you don't have to think too hard about how C works.\nEDIT: Understanding type promotion is an exception to this.  The integer type hierarchy is unfortunately (a) deeply baked into C and (b) mostly brain-dead \u2013 C mostly conflates physical integer width with modular arithmetic and provides no non-modular integer types, often leading to subtle software bugs (see last week's story about binary search).\nEDIT: So is understanding const-ness.  At least you can ignore this if you don't get it (or if C doesn't, as is the case with certain nested const types).","completion":"Const-ness is really different. It's a concept I really miss from other languages as it _adds_ more semantic information to the code. It does not obscure, it clarifies. It's a way to give orders instead of giving recommendations."}
{"prompt":"Yeah, if we couldn't do business with people who ever released software with security holes, none of us would have jobs.\nThe big fuck-up is when they told anyone with key problems to contact the guy who found the issue.

{"prompt":"One would hope that the completion of sync() would mean the data is written out, except I recently read this horror[1] on HN:\nUnfortunately, most consumer-grade mass storage devices lie about syncing. Disk drives will report that content is safely on persistent media as soon as it reaches the track buffer and before actually being written to oxide. This makes the disk drives seem to operate faster (which is vitally important to the manufacturer so that they can show good benchmark numbers in trade magazines). And in fairness, the lie normally causes no harm, as long as there is no power loss or hard reset prior to the track buffer actually being written to oxide. But if a power loss or hard reset does occur, and if that results in content that was written after a sync reaching oxide while content written before the sync is still in a track buffer, then database corruption can occur.\n\u2026 part of me hopes there's a very special hell for the people making disks where the OS can never be sure if the data is safe or not.\n[1]: http:\/\/www.sqlite.org\/howtocorrupt.html","completion":"This problem is nowhere near as widespread as most people claim. While bugs do happen and I can't speak for the SSD side of things, HDD manufactures test their cache behavior quite thoroughly. This includes pulling the power immediately after flushing the cache to make sure the data made it to disk. 99% of people who report cases of HDDs \"lying\" about write integrity either have write cache enabled or are not actually issuing a flush cache command due to OS level issues."}

{"prompt":"Sadly I'm increasingly coming to the conclusion that fuzzing all search traffic in this manner is becoming a necessity. My concern is that it's still not sufficient.

Fuzzing does appear that it might work, but given the current corpus of what the spy companies have, this is probably a bad avenue of approach.\nInstead, lets use The Pirate Bay.

{"prompt":"Having lived in Canada for 10 years, and recently moved back to the US because of health care, I can attest that while Canadian health care looks good on paper, it's not.  Sure, it's there when you need immediate emergency care.  But for anything long term, it's horrendous.  Autism, for example, is a perfect example, and something I know first hand.  In Quebec?  The best thing you can do for autistic children is to leave and get out of there.  My wife, a Canadian, was afraid when she first heard about US healthcare, but when she finally got to experience first hand the full brunt of the system, she despised it.  We had more help for my son in the first 2 weeks of being in the US then he'd had in more than year fighting for it in Canada.\nTo top this all off, Canada still has private insurance, and while you don't need it, if you don't have it, it makes for much lower quality of care (and don't think the public option covers essentials, either).\nSo, no.  I could never put my sons through a system like that again.  It was down right abuse, and I don't use that word lightly.","completion":"Different strokes.\nHaving lived in both countries, my experience in the U.S. was less than ideal. About the same amount of wait times as in Canada, and the doctors I saw gave me very little options as to how I could treat one of my chronic injuries. Never suggested a follow up appointment, physio, or even x-rays\/MRI's to get a better look. In Canada, they recommended me a specialist, and I have a nurse at a clinic who has built a great relationship with me to assess my needs when I need help, as well as x-rays\/MRI's done within a week.\nMy experience isn't like all in Canada or the U.S. but after touting how much better I thought the U.S. would be because of my great insurance and living in one of the top cities in the country, I wasn't impressed at all."}

{"prompt":"I have some similar thoughts.\nFor example, when people learn about 2-space and 3-space (or 2-d and 3-d arrays), the most common thing to do is to draw out the spatial analogue: a WxH table, a WxHxD cube. And so the examples always stop at 3.\nBut in math you don't stop anywhere. I have wondered if people who have extreme finesse with math at arbitrary dimensions change strategies when dealing with higher dimensions, or if they never did this spatial conversion all along and deal with it completely symbolically.\nThen I tried to think of what certain things mean symbolically. In integration it's always the area. But in symbols it's just a cold, unfriendly product. I'm sure there are merits to doing it this way, but I have trouble seeing intuitive meaning in it. Perhaps the better mathematicians simply calculate and don't care about what sense it makes?","completion":"I'm not one of the better mathematicians so I cannot know, but I suspect you are right. And if you think of physicists, much of what they do is finding out what space is in the first place. So for them to rely on spatial metaphors or visualisations could be downright destructive to their thinking. And I believe the same holds for much of the logic we create in software."}
{"prompt":"The author of the article isn't on a tenure-track, it is the author of the article excerpted in the above article. This author (Tom Coates) does make an excellent observation: \"The aim of doctoral work is not - no matter what anyone tells you - to think up good stuff and write great works and reveal your genius to the world. The aim is to make professional people who can teach undergraduates, deliver papers and - yes - also (subsequently) push the discipline further in one direction or another. You have to approach your post-graduate work in this way. The most successful doctoral students in my experience are the ones that are thorough and careful and take on relatively unambitious projects which don't stretch the assumptions or structures of the discipline too much. They're the ones that finish their doctoral work and go on to useful teaching positions (and then may or may not start exploring more widely). It's definitely not the best and the brightest, the most imaginative thinkers or the people with the great ideas that get through. If they get through it's because they're thorough and they're careful and they're professional and treat it as it should be treated - as a job of work rather than a calling or an exploration.\"\nThis resonates really well with my personal experience. Conscientiousness is the word to keep in mind.\nAnother thing to keep in mind is that the 22-year old kid just starting graduate school is very different from the 27-year old standing at the other end with a burnt wick. You cannot predict how your interests evolve, but you should at least try and gauge if your current interests run deep enough to allow for the sacrifice of four, five, or six years.","completion":"The relevant question, for one who does want to produce great work, is not whether grad school is suited more towards conscientious professionalism than truly novel, ambitious work, but whether it is a better day job than your other options. There are many circumstances where grad school is a fine place to stabilize the ebb and flow of creativity. There are smart people, exciting people, young people, old people, quiet spaces, interesting places, filled libraries, helpful secretaries, lab space, scholarships, grants, cafeterias, late cafes, open projects, secret projects, rich people, hackers, artists, scientists, writers, politicians, playwrights, music, sports, and a reasonable story that you can use to answer family questions about 'what you're doing with your life'.\nThere are problems, though. There's a lot of pressure to do things that are either in the academic norm, or are part of the academic fashion. Unfortunately, such things tend to get popular after the first people start getting interested in it, who often cover so much ground that there's little to do. So you need to stay away from academic groupthink if you want to do good work there -- but otherwise, it's a good place."}

{"prompt":"And unlike many such services, they still list you as the owner of the domain; they just mask the email\/address\/phone information.","completion":"I'm not sure if this is a positive or negative comment, but I'll explain why they do that.\nThere are two main ways to mask domain name whois information: 1) go through a proxy service, i.e., a company buys the domain under their name and gives you control, or 2) effectively use another entity's contact information with the exception of name, which is what Gandi does.\na) is rather risky to both parties. You do not own the domain, but another entity does. If you somehow lose the domain name or the entity holding the name goes under, you won't be able to get it back because it technically never belonged to you. The holder is also now legally responsible for the domain name.\nb) is a much safer route with the constraint that your name must be attached to the domain name.

Once there is an initial group of hosts, I'll open the site for meal booking.\nHosts will be able to create meals other users can book a seat at. Hosts will be able to filter the users prior to booking. Users will pay through the site prior to getting directions to the host's home.\nI think this will be great for people who love to cook, love trying new foods, and especially travelers.  Trying real pad see ew with a Thai family would be mind blowing (at least to me).\nIn terms of the legality of booking a meal at a person's home, I am not sure.  Each state\/country has their own regulations so until it grows to a point where that is a problem, I'm not worrying about it.\nWhat do you guys think about the site \/ strategy? Thanks for your time and thoughts.\nEmile\nEmile@housefed.com\nPS if you remember the HN post 'Quit Job, Learning to Code' back in July ( http:\/\/goo.gl\/cxNsr ), that was from me. I have been at it since then day and night. Thanks to everyone who has helped over the last few months. You too can learn how to code.","completion":"I think the concept has real potential but right now I think the first impression (what people see, the design, the explanation, etc) is really sub-par. As someone else posted, I went there to work out what the deal was, saw some photos of food (some uncooked\/unprepared) and couldn't work out what was going on, so I bailed. And I think I could be a potential customer or host - I love travel, food, I've used AirBnB a few times, etc.\nI think starting with photo-sharing is a bad idea, or at least it should not be a focus. Rather, hand-pick people (even with key dishes in mind) to feature on your front page. Have a pilot dinner or two, even if you have to find random tourists and offer to cook them dinner, and get a case study\/testimonial or two up there with photos of the guests with their hosts. Just don't call them case studies\/testimonials but something more natural and homely.\nDitch \"food porn\" - people don't want to eat at someone's house because it's fancy or the photos are pro, they'll eat there because they want the local experience. They want authentic homely French in a village cottage. They want Chinese with a multi-generational family in the hutongs. Ditch \"airbnb\" until you can better explain what you're doing.\nThere is a risk that people will not see your site as a meal-booking thing. They will see it as it is now and then never bother with it again. You're right to try and get feedback early and keep things moving, but I reckon your MVP needs to be closer to your eventual concept even if your withhold actual bookings for a while.\nI'm a web designer in Australia who works remotely with a few people in addition to my local clients. If you want some cheap help with your design and\/or to bounce off for feedback \/ideas for free, email me (email in profile).\nFirst impression: WTH is this? Waste of time.\nAfter realising what the deal is: Could see this going international and being awesome."}

That obstacle is quantum physics. Below a certain nanometer count, you're working at truly atomic scale, and Heisenberg effects start to kick in.\nQuantum computing may solve this issue, but realistically, probably not at a pace quick enough to keep Moore's Law operating on track the way it has been historically. More likely, we'll hit a plateau for awhile and eventually shatter it. When that happens, computers will be very different machines from what they are now. The shift from transistor-based computers to quantum computers will be akin to the shift from vacuum tubes to transistors.\nIn the meantime, we're probably just going to load up and more and more parallel processors.","completion":"Moore's Law doesn't explicitly say anything about density:\nThe most popular formulation is of the doubling of the number of transistors on integrated circuits every two years.\n(WP http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Moores_law#Other_formulations_a...)\nSo the density needs to increase only of the size if the size integrated circuit cannot increase."}

But kudos to these folks for making something that casual cyclists might actually want to use, won't attract thieves, and is cheap.  They should focus on the 98% of the market who will never pay $300-500 for a Garmin device (which anyway are hard to use).

If you can't convince a person that you're right about helping those people, and decide to simply impose an additional tax, then you're coercing them and treating your fellow citizens as objects to be milked, not as individuals to be convinced.\nBut anyway, if you have THAT many people living in poverty and you want to just give them money, there's  something wrong with either your assessment of what poverty is or with the solution you propose. The point is not to give money. Money are irrelevant. If you give money, you don't create wealth, you redistribute it. The point is to help all those people create value and, thus, wealth."}
{"prompt":"I get the impression that public waves were a quick hack that Google created to give new users someone to interact with while the network is new & small.  (If you just got onboard, it's likely that you only have one friend, and that could get boring very quickly.  Furthermore, enabling mass public interaction would give theme some stress situations to test how their infrastructure scales, and how their GWT client scales in the browser.)   The strange fake contact that one has to add as a wave participant is one indicator.  Another is the fact that with:public is undocumented.\nOnce the service is completely open, it's unlikely that this hack will be needed any longer.  I wouldn't be surprised to see the public@a.gwave.com user retired after a while, anyway.","completion":"I hope that the public pipeline is maintained as long as possible.

If so, we all need to be a bit clearer on it.\nIf qsort's comparison function is a callback, is that true of any function argument to any higher-order function?  If so, why the additional term?

Why not call copyright infringement \"arson\" or \"murder\" too?\nMaking an unlicensed replica of another person's non-rival good is not the same thing as depriving another person of a rival good in their possession.  You can even hold both to be worthy of legal censure without having to advance this disingenuous prevarication.\nIf you're in favor of strict IP law, do you not see how playing these semantic games actually undermines your credibility and therefore your argument?","completion":"The thing is, law is nothing more than codified morality. I do believe, in a court of law, that we should make a distinction between theft and copyright. Several Supreme Court justices agree that this is the case. However, when looking and the very core of the issue, absent legal codification, I'm still taking something that isn't mine, regardless of whether or not it was merely a copy. That is where I am coming from. Responsible adults shouldn't need to split legal hairs, we should recognize that we are, at its core, taking what is not ours to take. There is a legal distinction, but not a moral one."}

{"prompt":"It's unclear to me whether you want \"to write a program\" or to \"get the maximum out of Haskell\". Those are two very different goals.","completion":"The thing is, I can write a program in any language.

Again, this is the end game of months or years of work that already happened.\nWhere is it the conferences responsibility (and to what advantage) to extend themselves to garnering talks and presenters from a minority industry segment (and which minority segments?). Do you actually have demonstrable evidence that presenters and papers of merit are being excluded from conferences?

I admit that. But it's clearly observable. I'm sure many people here observe it regularly.\nYou specify the problem the wrong way around.\nThe women got pregnant because the maternity grant was offered as is a cosy council house and a career of being pregnant. That's how it works here.\nWhen you have three children like myself you spend a lot of time around parents and maternity units and the general consensus of the particular social stereotype is that a baby is a meal ticket and the \u00a3500 would go nicely on some Uggs and enough Silk Cut to get you through the first 9 months after it's born.\nYou can see the results of the maternity grant spending at ASDA which is basically the decked out in designer brand children being pushed around in their expensive buggy but the mother is buying \u00a350 worth of cigarettes and her other three children are consigned to economy grade processed meat wrapped in breadcrumbs and some reconstituted potato product and some panda pops as their entire diet.\nIt's not down to poverty: just selfish idiocy, apathy and a complete lack of morals and ethics."}

The alternative is to partner with Microsoft and aim to be a major player in a 'third way' ecosystem. Really this isn't about how many ecosystems, its about the size of Nokia's slice of the ecosystem they chose. So they're taking the risk that WP7 will become a viable platform over the risk that they'd be a bit player in an Android world.","completion":"I heard that a lot, but - I'm not sure that I agree. There are other manufacturers of WP7 handsets already.

String tries were roughly 10x slower than binary searching an array for a 20k word corpus, which is probably around the size you're dealing with here.  They have terrible cache locality - each character makes you follow a pointer, which is probably a cache miss, and the total size of the trie is on the order of 26 * 8 * 20k = 4M.

{"prompt":"Do you have any insight into how it compares to lock-free techniques?\nA full-blown (say) lock-free hash table is almost insurmountable - I recall seeing an efficient reusable implementation a couple of years ago, but most before that had serious performance or correctness issues. However, if you take this into account early enough in the design of the system, you can usually do with much simpler lock free data structures (seqlock and friends).\ntransactional memory is, of course, a useful abstraction when you can't (or didn't) take this into account upfront.","completion":"Lock-freedom is all about progress, not performance.  i.e. generally the only reason to use a lock-free algorithm is if you have issues with ill-behaved code stalling other processes.  (I can think of several simple ways to make a fast concurrent hash table, none of which provide lock-freedom, yet which avoid taking locks when necessary.)\nTransactional memory is an access abstraction that presents memory as something over which transactions can be made.  It says nothing about whether the implementation is lock-free (though the better implementations approach, or are lock-free).  There exist software TM algorithms which lock during the transaction, which lock only briefly at the end of the transaction, and which are lock-free, and some which are a combination of these.\nTSX (specifically HLE) only takes a lock if the transaction fails without taking a lock, in order to guarantee forward progress in the absence of an ill-behaved transaction (assuming fair locks).  Were the software fallback implemented using lock-free techniques (possible with the more general RTM portion of TSX), this guarantee would extend to ill-behaved transactions as well."}

{"prompt":"9 releases in 3 years -- anyone else think that's too much? I'm a mobile developer and just keeping up with Google\/Apple updates is a huge task. It's almost come to a point where they ignore serviceability of products and just keep churning out new ones, expecting the eco system to keep up. And given Google's 'excellent' QA, my code is full of runtime-conditional checking to enable\/disable features based on the user's version. Since users are slow to upgrade (carriers slow to push updates), the test matrix just keeps growing and keeps getting more complex.\nEach SDK introduces new permissions, so now your app doesn't auto-update anymore. Which means you have a bunch of different versions of your app floating around, without converging. (I can write a whole essay about how their permissions stuff is broken - see iOS' model for a non-broken alternative).\nThere is a reason Honeycomb adoption is abysmal - developers haven't gotten around to customizing their apps for it, which in turn results in lower sales of Honeycomb devices. And keeping up this pace isn't going to make it easier.\nAm I just being unreasonable here, or do others feel some of this pain too?","completion":"I thought Honeycomb was a tablet-only release. It will necessarily have a lower market share than universal\/phone Android releases."}

In addition, the company will have a higher payroll tax burden because of the higher salaries. (1) is somewhat justifiable as investing in your employees may garner loyalty\/harder work which may raise the top-line, but (2) seems unlikely. There are a lot of credit card processing companies.\nWhat happens if profits aren't as good next year? Are they going to slash wages to previous levels (or lower)? Or, if he's intent on sticking to the $70k minimum wage, this means he'll have to let go more people if the time comes.

We have dedicated ops teams happy to automate deployments, hardware load balancers and are rarely doing anything CPU intensive.\n2) It ignores language trends. Functional programming is what is hot right with Scala and Clojure being what most enterprises are choosing to adopt for the next big project. Why ? Because they can leverage all their existing Java libraries\/practices but without the boilerplate and language overhead of Java.\n3) It ignores architectural trends. Go's concurrency approaches are nice but aren't that special and again aren't that useful in most cases. Unless you are someone like Cloudflare it is far easier to just horizontally scale your app servers across seperate instances. It's more expensive but hardly worth deciding your platform over.","completion":"We've been using Scala for a while now. It's a major step-up from Java in terms of sheer programming enjoyment (contrary to what the criticism parrots who don't actually use it would have you believe). Java is still very widely used, but most don't use it by choice anymore but rather because it's the default or what the existing code is written in. Go is a non-starter for us due to a lack of support for existing Java libs, and isn't all that interesting compared to the alternatives."}

{"prompt":"That's not completely true. At least with the GNU tools, 'rm' won't delete the root directory unless you specifically give it the '--no-preserve-root' flag. Since that flag has no use outside of deleting root, it's unlikely it has the flag on it. With that in mind the script must do some type of manual deleting for some reason.","completion":"I believe that \"--preserve-root\" applies only to \/ itself.

{"prompt":"The first two points seem like non-constructive scab picking that could apply to almost any project launched around here.\n1. Glif, Wii, Flickr or Forrst are hardly any better. Unless they're generic words, names become valuable. \"Y Combinator\" itself is a pretty weird name for a business if you ignore the context of everything it has gone on to do and represent. \"Fowndr\" only sounds cheap now because it's new and doesn't have any history.\n2. Why does it matter if the barrier is low? Any barrier that cuts down the useless 90% is fine. The term \"founder\" is self selecting anyway.

They do nothing for build up of metabolic waste products, for example, which are direct causes of a range of issues.\nThere is an assumption in the research community that, yes, stochastic DNA damage and epigenetic drift in tissues has to be important in aging in ways other than cancer, but there isn't any good experiment to demonstrate that this is in fact the case. If anything the available evidence points in the opposite direction, such as mice loaded with a large multiple of the normal level of point mutations that don't appear to suffer any consequences as a result.\nWhen you look at what kills the most people, cardiovascular disease, it all appears to be fairly directly linked to a combination of degredation of elasticity in blood vessel walls (cross-links in the extracellular matrix, a metabolic waste product issue), damaged lipids in blood vessel walls spawning self-reinforcing damage generators (mitochondrial DNA damage, inflammation), and things of that ilk, which lead to hypertension and runaway bad feedback loops in blood pressure and the body's response to same, and then catastrophic failures or blockages in blood vessels. Stem cells and their declining activity are something of a secondary issue in the background, and don't really figure in the important path through this pathology. If your skin and blood vessel walls are loaded up with cross-links that the body cannot break down and increasingly inelastic as a result then it doesn't matter how youthful your stem cells are, you are still on the path to death."}

Email providers cannot ensure this level of safety, only end-users themselves using tools like PGP, which is unfortunately still a mystery to many people. The sad truth is that end-to-end encryption requires know-how and a bit of effort (even if just a little). Most people don't care enough, or are just confused by it.

{"prompt":"nan","completion":"Claiming that \"terminals are the future once again\" is hardly controversial. How much (time\/money\/mind share) are invested in non-networked, desktop-style apps? Some, yes, but \"everyone\" seem to be (continuing) the push for networked apps (MS Office and Exchange\/Sharepoint, Google (everything), Adobe\/Macromedia with Creative Cloud, Apple iCloud ...). Mozilla is doing a cloud-push to, but have thankfully so far had a very strong self-host, do-what-you-please story. Not sure about the Firefox OS, though -- will we be able to (easily) host our own app store? Back-end services? At least for now the things I use (Firefox sync) is easy and feasible to self-host.\nThe one thing I could see giving a resurgence to \"off-line\" for mainstream use, is latency -- more concretely -- the low latency tolerance of VR. But then again, as long as you can stream enough data\/logic to the \"terminal\" -- even that shouldn't be a problem.\nI do hope the industry can help shift things towards locally cacheable\/locally hostable solutions, though. I'd much rather run some \"cloud\" office suite on my server, with the option of taking it with me off-line from time to time (and then perhaps sync up whenever I'm on-line) -- than having my data on a third-party server. Or servers.\nI'm afraid the more likely future, is a future where a majority of users are locked-in to the whims of mega-corps -- and the scariest part of that, is that those that are leading in providing \"cloud\" services actually have a business model that centres around (ab)using the data, not charging for the services they provide."}
{"prompt":"This seems ridiculous. This belief doesn't scale past a few programmers\/employees.\nIf you are \"doing it right\", your time should be worth far more than a programmer's salary.\nI run several websites\/businesses.

Because, I'm one. Currently, my post-doctoral research is focused on structure guided drug design against HIV and Cancer targets, working closely with industrial groups. Other researchers in the group work on Hepatitis C targets, so I'm familiar with challenges. In the past, I worked at a drug discovery start-up on metabolic disease targets.

{"prompt":"Except this isn't about beliefs and opinions, but about science. You can question evolution with the scientific method if you want to.\nAnd \"save the kids\" seems a bit more applicable when applied to teachers who are paid to educate said kids.","completion":"\"Save The Kids\" is an appeal to emotion and is used to avoid addressing the logic and reason of the situation. If the children are in danger then you should have no problem listing the explicit points where such actions can cause irreparable harm. Otherwise you are simply trying to shortchange the debate and prevent discourse.\nThe way I see it, a parent has been forced to parent. While I don't have children, I remember my parents being forced to intervene with teachers on a whole host of issues. Does this mean we should ban all teachers who disagree with any parent on any issue?"}
{"prompt":"I'm sorry most of the sugar I don't find particularly helpful and can be confusing when you have more than one way to do something. generators, async keyword these should be prioritized not class based inheritance. Even block scoping I mean maybe I'm nuts but function scoping if you take the time to understand it, it works.","completion":">generators, async keyword these should be prioritized not class based inheritance\nGenerators are indeed being prioritized over classes and inheritance; the former is starting to see support in browsers but there's no sign of the latter.\nThe async-await keywords are not in ES6, but they are trivial to mimic with generators and promises if you so desire.\n>Even block scoping I mean maybe I'm nuts but function scoping if you take the time to understand it, it works.\nBlock scoping introduces no new pitfalls (unless you count learning two new keywords a pitfall). It does however eliminate two classes of bugs - redeclaring a var with the intent of shadowing the previous one but actually overwriting it, and using a var outside of a scope where it has a legal value. I'd say it's worth it."}

Sad but true."}
{"prompt":"(please don't compare things to cancer, it does both a disservice)","completion":"Of course, you're right about this.  I think the comparison detracted from my point, and it was insensitive to people for whom cancer is not a metaphor.  So, really it failed on two counts.  I'm sorry about that, and am grateful for the feedback.\nI was trying (without much success) to highlight a possible underlying principle in organizational development and growth of a local economy, not to imply that Amazon (or any other business) invites comparison to a devastating disease, because I don't believe they do.  That town would be better off if Amazon had a half dozen strong competitors just like it, in factories across the street.  I just think a town can't rest all its hopes in one company.  I grew up in a town with about 600 households and 800 or so people working in one factory.  When that factory went away, it was very hard on the local economy, for the families who relied on it, for the schools, and generally for everyone in the community.  It seems, and I might be wrong about this, that local policies to encourage and reward entrepreneurial growth and diversification of the local economy could have provided a stronger buffer against the inevitable end of its once solid manufacturing sector.  I've been pretty fortunate since then to live in places where there were hundreds of employers competing in dozens of industries, and which had a healthy cultural ferment, many different ideas to talk about, and innovation bubbling up all over the place."}

{"prompt":"Centralized systems are almost asking to be spying on, laws or not. Even if the NSA does not have the right to do what it did, I'm sure they'd end up doing by using corruption, and there are many ways to do it. Worse, it would open the door to a lot of other shady practices, and I'm sure criminal would make a buck out of it.\nThe fact that a huge quantity of information is put in one place increases the risk it will peeked into by a lot.\nDecentralized systems are a little more difficult to maintain and develop, but are so much cheaper and eliminate the risk of mass surveillance. There are still security risks depending on designs, but honestly I think decentralized has a lot of future, the advantages and features it brings counter balances the disadvantages by a lot.\nI wish bittorrent inc would produce more technologies and some competitor would really be cool.","completion":"I agree. As long as big companies become so good at tracking and making money through surveillance themselves, it's just too irresistible for spy agencies not to try and get that data one way or another.\nThat's why companies need to at least use forward secrecy, keep data at rest encrypted, and also delete more ephemeral data a lot more quickly.\nGoogle used to delete the data they have on their users every 6 months. I don't think they plan on ever deleting anything they have anymore now. That's the wrong way to go about it. Tracking data should not exist for more than a few months at most, and private communications should not be held for more than a year. Of course, it would be so much easier for the user, if everything was end-to-end encrypted, and then it wouldn't need to be deleted."}
{"prompt":"After observing a similar pattern at my last startup, I thought it might be a good idea to intentionally screw up something minor. Then we could apologize for it like this and maybe offer some small reward to make up for it.\nMy theory was that it would endear our customers to us that much more.\nI still haven't tested that theory, but I'd really like to some day.","completion":"Customers are endeared by this sort of thing because it's genuine. Simulating this effect with a fake trick may work, but it is not cool.\nAnd don't excuse it with \"companies everywhere do this all the time\" either. Everywhere and every time that kind of stunt is pulled, it is not cool."}
{"prompt":"I may very well be naive, but this is the first such situation I have heard of.  It is a really fascinating predicament for the writer.","completion":"It's super common, actually.

It's not nearly as devious as it sounds."}
{"prompt":"Thoughts:\n1. It doesn't appear to have O(1) lookup or O(1) insertion.\n2. It appears that this filter can become \"full\", which is very different from a bloom filter.\n3.

I'm not very confident that this has a constant space requirement either.\nThis seems like something that I wouldn't compare to a bloom filter.","completion":"1. It has O(1) lookups (it has to probe at most 2 constant-size buckets) and O(1) amortised insertions (the probability of needing more than k swaps to find an empty slot decreases exponentially with k).\n2. It's geared for low false positives, 3% or lower.\n3. It does have false positive on lookups: signatures are lossy.\n4.

{"prompt":"Summary: First impressions are weighted heavily when we form opinions of people. Once those opinions are formed it takes a lot of evidence to the contrary to cause us to re-evaluate our opinion of that person.","completion":"It's more general than that. If we form an opinion about X based on feature A, that opinion \"leaps\" to features B, C, and so on, even if they're unrelated. For example, I've noticed that once people think of a piece of software as fast, they're more likely to regard it as high-quality in other ways that have nothing to do with performance.\nEdit: another example is the well-known result that better looking people are rated as smarter, nicer, more competent, etc. IIRC, they're even less likely to get sent to prison and receive lighter sentences if they do."}
{"prompt":">This whole thing is a difficult issue. Who is to decide what devices look similar enough, to deserve calling it a \u201ccopy\u201d?\nHere's a guideline: if there is a document in your company saying (\"let's copy this thing\") --as in Samsung's case--, it's a copy.\nOr if you created your design from leaked photos of prototypes (\"as in this case\") --it's a copy.\nFor the rest, how about a \"jury\" (i.e impartial to both parties common people)?","completion":"Even when we directly say \u201cWe\u2019ll copy it!\u201d, it could still come out as having the classifier outputting a small confidence value.

{"prompt":"Caltrain is already pretty good on the Peninsula.  Since the various towns on the Peninsula were founded in the railroad era, the Caltrain stops conveniently in each downtown.\nWhere would a BART line run on the Peninsula?  Down 101 from Millbrae?  Such a route would cost billions over some of the most expensive real estate in the country, yet wouldn't serve the denser parts of the peninsula well.\nModernizing the Caltrain seems like a much better use of money.  It's clear from the website that this stuff is very expensive!\nIf we want to dream, a BART extension from Milpitas through Santa Clara (and the new stadium) to link up with the light rail and Caltrain in downtown Mountain View would be awesome, though!","completion":"Caltrain is not \"already pretty good\". It has antiquated, overweight trains due to federal requirements and the fact that it shares track with freight traffic. Those trains can't accelerate properly, so those \"convenient\" stops in each downtown mean the trains can't run with enough frequency. There are not enough trains and too many at grade crossings, which produce severe noise pollution (due to the federal horn sounding requirements).\nCaltrain is WAY overdue for upgrades. The electrification project, which will solve some but not all of these problems, is in need of a speedup. Many at grade crossings need to be replaced with bridges (and some are being replaced), but because of all the fiefdom-like towns along the way, getting anything done along the right-of-way is a nightmare.\nAlthough there is no tractable way to merge Caltrain with BART (because of BART's own foolish planning decisions, such as a custom gauge), and you're right that there is no space for a second right-of-way, there is another neglected project that would benefit here: Dumbarton Rail (http:\/\/www.bayrailalliance.org\/dumbarton_rail). At various points it was suggested that either BART or Caltrain should be extended across that bridge - either way, completing that link would add badly needed capacity in a region that has long neglected its traffic infrastructure."}

{"prompt":"Fuck karma in general. I can't think of a practical use for publishing the karma number. Real karma ripples throughout the world on it's own, you don't need a number to record it.\nThere's far too much ego worship in communities like HN, where nerds are often too concerned with it to begin with.

If you ignore that, then it is relatively easy to implement if in any reasonable language.

{"prompt":"I'm surprised that they didn't mention Leo Breiman's famous paper \"Statistical Modelling: The Two Cultures\"[0]. A worthwhile read for anyone interested in the topic. I could sum it up, but the abstract does a better job:\n----------\nAbstract.\nThere are two cultures in the use of statistical modeling to\nreach conclusions from data. One assumes that the data are generated\nby a given stochastic data model. The other uses algorithmic models and\ntreats the data mechanism as unknown. The statistical community has\nbeen committed to the almost exclusive use of data models. This commitment has led to irrelevant theory, questionable conclusions, and has kept\nstatisticians from working on a large range of interesting current prob-\nlems. Algorithmic modeling, both in theory and practice, has developed\nrapidlyin fields outside statistics. It can be used both on large complex\ndata sets and as a more accurate and informative alternative to data\nmodeling on smaller data sets. If our goal as a field is to use data to\nsolve problems, then we need to move awayfrom exclusive dependence\non data models and adopt a more diverse set of tools.\n[0].http:\/\/tuvalu.santafe.edu\/~aaronc\/courses\/5352\/readings\/Brei...","completion":"Fantastic paper.

I know that it was legally parked because the night before, I parked next to her and noticed that her parking pass was a different color than mine, so I made a note to ask her about it in my cell phone.  The next day, the car was gone.\nThe issue is, you are essentially powerless to do anything about it, except pay the extortion.  I spoke with a police officer about it after I had to call them a week or so later about an unrelated matter, and he suggested that if something like that were to happen again, we should get an officer to come out and order the parking management company to have the vehicle returned.  He said that he had the towing company in question tow a car back to where it was parked before, and did believe that they frequently tow legally parked vehicles in the area.  Unfortunately, it could be very difficult (impossible?) to actually get an officer to come out, if the vehicle has been reported towed."}

{"prompt":"The life hack to actually come out ahead is to avoid these places and find a good opportunity in a cheaper place.

Barring building a successful business, a lottery-style liquidity event or selling your soul to some hedge fund, I don't see a reliable way to live in NYC, SFO, etc and coming out with any wealth.","completion":"The other life hack people do is to move to SF or NYC out of college, try to \"make it\", live like a grad student, bank a large savings cushion, and then retire to a cheaper place with a high quality of life when they want to have a family.\nI have a few friends at Google who, after working there for close to 10 years, now are thinking about retiring to Portland, or Vermont, or North Carolina.  The idea has certainly crossed my mind, that if I wanted to live in a rural area I could buy a house free & clear and be set for the rest of my life.

{"prompt":"The last technical section raised a question I've never thought about: when the mining runs out in a hundred years, how will new blocks holding transactions be added to the block chain?\nMy intuition is that there's a difference between the proof of work for the purpose of the block chain versus mining coin that's glossed over in this article.  Any description I remember seeing conflates the two.  Is there something more going on there?\nI suppose then transaction costs will necessarily rise to cover the discrepancy, though it seems like an efficient market so they'll probably just replace the reward.","completion":"The amount of BTC that gets \"mined\" when a block is created is orthogonal to the difficulty of the proof of work.\nBlocks will continued to be mined at a constant rate (in mainline BTC, 1 per 10 minutes) indefinitely. The proof-of-work required for the next block to be considered valid--basically, how small a percentage of the hash search-space your hashed block has to land within--is based on the difference in timestamps of the blocks that came recently before it; effectively, the faster blocks make it into the chain, the harder it becomes to mine another, and the slower blocks make it in, the easier it becomes to mine another.\nOn the other hand, the BTC that the miner gets from a block is basically an implicit transaction included in the block, and acts just like any other one signed inside the block, transferring a given amount of money \"out of thin air\" into the account of the miner. Like any other transaction, the validity of this transaction for any given amount is a matter of policy set by the consensus of the network of bitcoin clients. The policy on the BTC network for how much money is valid to claim in an \"out of thin air\" transaction is a function of the block's timestamp\/blockchain depth; as more blocks get mined over time, the amount of money it's valid to claim in the sourceless transaction in your block diminishes to zero. These implicit transactions will still, technically, be happening every time a block is created--they'll just be for a below-quantum (1 satoshi) amount of BTC, and thus discarded in accounting.\nIn the distant future, blocks will still be being mined one-per-ten-minutes, but their timestamp\/block-id will translate into them no longer having any implicit value. They will, however, still have the explicit value of the transaction fees invested into them by the transactions they sign."}

{"prompt":"\"To get the most performance out of the PCs of the day, I believe he had the register itself more or less directly read and write transaction data from disk.\"\nI don't buy this excuse. It just sounds like bad code to me.","completion":"Times were different back then. The article says the original control dates from 1990, and wikipedia confirms that Windows 3.0 came out in 1990 so it is plausible. The 486 had just been released in the previous year, so it was the New Hotness and not very many people had it, so you'd be looking at an install base of mostly 80386s with a substantial contingent of 80286s that your program still needed to run on with acceptable performance. Wikipedia says for the 80286 you're looking at a top-end of 12MHz, with 6 and 8 MHz in the field. Since this is a Windows 3.0 program, you had a minimum of 640KB on the system (though of course you can't use it all).\nSo this is a program that has to run with reasonable performance on a 12MHz 80286 with 2MB of RAM. Are you sure you wouldn't consider having your UI read and write the disk directly? Separation of concerns is a modern luxury. And remember, you're using compilers from 1990, too. Don't expect great inlining. (Besides, only profligate memory spendthrifts would inline a function.)\n(Edit, later followup: In fact, \"separation of concerns\" is one of the major sources of the \"bloat\" people complain about when they examine modern OSes. Much of the \"non-bloated-ness\" of earlier generations of OS doesn't come from programmers caring more about their craft, it comes from programmers having to stuff programs into things that can barely hold them and building \"clever things\" that we would today consider monstrosities like UI widgets that read and write directly to the disk. I am unsympathetic to accusations that, say, a modern KDE desktop is \"bloated\".)"}
{"prompt":"It's some delicious sour grapes.\nGo back in time a while, and the reason that Android was absolutely doomed was that it was a fragmented collection of devices and interfaces that would only confuse and turn off the consumer, with little or no coherent branding (many consumers don't even know what Android is), whereas the iPhone is one or two simple devices that have a singler back, a very strong brand identity, you know what you'll get, etc.\nMG Siegler is worse than John Gruber -- at least Gruber is seeing the writing on the wall and is starting to sing a different tune.","completion":"\"Seeing the writing on the wall...\"\nReally? Is this what it has come to? I bought an iPhone 3G on day one, used it until the Nexus One came out, and have recently gone back to iOS and bought an iPhone 4.\nWhy?

I'll repeat that again: the quality of the iPhone and iOS4 remains the same regardless of its market share!\nI love Android's openness, and I even use Google Voice as my sole telephone number (yes, even with my iPhone 4). Wasn't enough; couldn't take the glitchiness, even in Android 2.2, and other annoying features of Android.\nBecause I know someone will yell \"provide examples,\" here are some superior iOS apps that have no rival on Android: Reeder for iPhone (NewsRob is okay...), Twitter (Twitter for Android is okay...), Instapaper, Simplenote (there are glitchy apps that use the Simplenote API on Android), Dropbox (can't save for local access on Android), Pastebot, Calcbot, Convertbot (all are great examples of apps that are possible on Android, but have no where near the attention to detail), BeejiveIM, Calendar (yes I know Android has a calendar app, but it's weak), Mail (for all non-Gmail accounts, Android sucks, and for Gmail accounts, I find iOS4 to be equal to Android's stock Gmail app), etc. Oh, and I forgot to include all of the games that Android lacks, but I don't really play games so I didn't miss them with my Nexus One.\nPoint is, not everything is zero-sum; I can enjoy my iPhone regardless of how small or large its market share is!

Look at the lips relative to the skin.\nThat said, it looks like it was a non-linear change to the contrast curve.  The eyebrows have roughly the same tone in both images, as do the eyes.  If I had to guess, the contrast was adjusted in the mid-gray region, with the extremes left unaffected.  I'm also guessing that this illusion has to do with the contrast of skin tone between facial features -- not facial shadows (which can definitely affect the perception of beauty)."}

Unless your target market is musicians or freelancers, your audience isn't sure what it means.\nThe first rule of copywriting is to highlight benefits, not features. So don't rave about your powerful search that can filter by territory, hours, or experience.

Do people really need or want this?","completion":"I'm so glad to have this feedback. Identifying my audience and avoiding feature speak where two things I tried to give consideration to while writing the copy. Still, I couldn't work out how to accomplish that.\nThe biggest difference from TaskRabbit is likely the direction of communication. GigYard encourages you to seek out and engage a candidate based on your needs. While TaskRabbit encourages you to describe your needs then promotes them to candidates for bidding.\nFor simple tasks I think the TaskRabbit approach works well. I expect that GigYard will be used to find service providers that meet more specific requirements."}

Is the situation similar to Australia?","completion":"As a Brazilian, I see these factors (not only for PS4, but for all imported items and some domestically manufactured too):\n- Insane taxation ('nuff said);\n- Primitive transport infrastructure (bad roads, don't ever try to put something expensive into the postal system (it will be destroyed by mishandling or simply stolen), etc.)\n- Dysfunctional economy (change rates float wildly, government manipulation, etc.).\n- Inefficient and corrupt bureaucracy (Trying to open a company? Good luck. Trying to close it? Prepare for a nightmare. Needing a permit? Sit and wait, but some public servants may ask money to \"speed the things up\");\n- People are used to pay insane prices for a lot of items (electronic devices, cars, faucets and other bathroom metals (seriously), a housing bubble building up for some years, etc.). This is a major factor, btw. Even there is no real reason for keeping the prices high, they don't fall because people still paying."}
{"prompt":"The \"extra credit\" question at the end is a fascinating one, I think.  I would \/love\/ to hear the opposing side's answer, since we know the first image is not acceptable to them and presumably the final image would have to be.","completion":"Well, just because it's hard to decide exactly where to draw the line doesn't mean he can't cross it. I actually had the opposite take on this question. As I read, I wondered where the author would draw the line -- a grayscale version, one with pixels half as small as his, a 16-bit version? He didn't include intermediate images between his and the original, just between his and the extreme.\nThe truth is that his version just wasn't that different than the original iconic image. He used the image in exactly the same context, derived value from the similarity (that was the whole point), and derived revenue from the sales. So how is this okay?"}
{"prompt":"Is the long term goal to create a new library (why not in boost) or to test new ideas to extend the language ?","completion":"From the presentation materials included in the repo, it looks like it's intended to be a library example of what they'd like to be a language extension."}
{"prompt":"1.  I consider companies to be achieving when they turn a profit.  So do investors.\n2.  The companies here are not under-achievers; they are non- achievers.\n3.

More or less a very complicated high risk for all involved outsourcing of big company R+D.  So... what happens when you're medium sized aka too expensive to sell, and also old news rather than being something new?\nIf you're a million dollar company with the brand new idea of selling dog food over the internet, a perfectly valid exit strategy is during a bubble, sell for ten million to Amazon because thats they cheapest fastest way for them to get into the lucrative dog food delivery market.

{"prompt":"I know that there is(or was) a place like you described for book authors on Google hangout. They would just meet in a room and not really have a conversation but only be present. The goal was to get a motivational boost by seeing other people working and doing the stuff you should be doing too, which in that case would be writing. I imagine it could work for some people. So I say try to find something on Google hangout. And when you have found something tell me about it :)","completion":"Couldn't find anything so far, although a Google Hangout does sound like something that might work."}
{"prompt":">Where are the macrostructures? We don't see Dyson spheres or other evident macroscale engineering. Everything we can see so far looks natural. This is more troubling than an absence of detectable communications.\nAssuming a Dyson sphere was nearby, how would we detect it? What would it look like? If it's able to make use of most of a star's radiation output, wouldn't that make it very difficult to see? It wasn't until recently that we were able to detect black holes and I'd have to guess a Dyson sphere's star would be much less massive and energetic than that.","completion":"Even a Dyson sphere can't just swallow the star's radiation. It makes use of a potential gradient, which means it would have to radiate away some energy on the outside. This would probably show up as, say, a brown dwarf. Still, if it's not in our direct neighborhood the chances of us discovering it are even lower."}
{"prompt":"Seems like a good opportunity to use [Gitlab](https:\/\/about.gitlab.com\/) and a perhaps even a hosted Gitlab install?

{"prompt":"A coworker and I wrote a script that's been through a few iterations based on feedback and tailored to whatever company I'm hiring for.  Based on the participants self-rating (1-10) you can ask increasingly more nuanced questions in each area of CSS, HTML, and JS. Here's the front-end interview script I use:  https:\/\/gist.github.com\/potench\/e71e09c882628054c119\nSo far it seems to do a good job at promoting conversation and identifying thoughtful and talented FE developers.","completion":"This is a good list. Can I ask you something though? I've always been curious about the value of questions like these (just to take a sample):\n> On a scale of 1-10, what is your comfort level developing with HTML, CSS & JavaScript?\n> How well do you think you work with other fellow developers?\n> Given a choice, would you rather work alone or in tandem with someone?\nWhat are the \"correct\" answers to these? Or more specifically, in your opinion what are the \"wrong\" answers?\nOn the first, the problem I see is one of self-reporting. We have seen developers self-report a 9 on something, only for us to determine later based on the interview that they were more like a 5. We didn't put value on either of these numbers, because both were relative - the \"9\" was presumably relative to his previous job environment, and the \"5\" was relative to ours. (At another company the person could've been a \"2\", for example.) Fact is, it doesn't really matter - we were just looking to see if the person can add value, regardless of whether they were a 5 or a 10.\nOn the latter two: we have had \"loners\" crank out incredible bits of code on their own, and \"team people\" do the same as part of a larger group. We have also seen people switch between the two \"personality types\" based on context - the specific project, their team mates for the project, and so on.\nSo we prefer not to ask these types of questions as we don't seem to get any relevant information out of them, but perhaps we're missing something, and so I'm curious as to what your motivations are."}
{"prompt":"Give the guy due process at least....\nSorry, had to add that","completion":"No need to apologize. Trail and conviction by mob is odious whether the mob is a collection of allegedly intelligent and educated hackers or whether it\u2019s beer-guzzling trailer-trash.\nThe bottom line is, you have an accusation on the Internet without the benefit of an accused person facing their accusers, without a process for presenting and evaluating evidence in context, and without any kind of judge or referee in place to rule on any issues of admissibility or propriety.\nWe get together and lament how places like Fox news can distort the truth and present biased cases against people. And then when something comes along and plays to our prejudices, we whip out the torches and pitchforks, planning to ruin the accused plagiarizer and whatever professor may or may not have accepted this ridiculous essay.\nQuite honestly, I find the thought of this person suffering in the future when they apply for a job somewhere entirely repugnant. Now, if there is some process and he is expelled from school or censured on his academic record, let him explain that to whomever asks. But the idea of having to defend himself against mob sentiment is a giant step backwards to frontier justice.\nPeople fuss and fret over surrendering their liberties to the TSA. We should think about what part of civilized behaviour we voluntarily surrender when we act like this."}
{"prompt":"Regardless of whether the person who wrote that should be fired, calling that post \"hate speech\" demonstrates a pretty fundamental misunderstanding of what hate speech is. It is not merely exclusionary speech, and it is not merely speech that singles out particular groups - only protected groups. Holding particular political views - no matter how popular or right they might be, and no matter how persecuted you may feel for holding them - does not qualify you as belonging to a protected group.\nIf you want to fire this person, fire them for misrepresenting the Mozilla organization in a public forum. Stating that the tech industry will be better off without feminists - while a pretty stupid opinion to have - is not even remotely \"hate speech\", and while it might make Chris Beard feel a little more righteous to call it that, it does not reflect well on his capacity for rational thought.","completion":"I was expecting some vitriol, but the comments left on that user now are pretty tame (perhaps there were bad ones that have been deleted). Rude, calling someone an asshole and mocking their fashion, but not even close to hate speech. Unless everyone that's made fun of Trump in the last month is also guilty of hate speech."}
{"prompt":"he should be comparing docker to xen paravirtual or openvz, NOT kvm.","completion":"The intent of the benchmark was to show benefits of LXC as a technology in the Cloudy space. It just so happened I chose docker as the LXC \"provider\" for these tests -- it could have just as easily been libvirt-lxc or something else.\nGiven OpenVZ is an LXC technology, comparing docker to OpenVZ would have been more of a comparison between different LXC providers. I agree this would be interesting, however not in line with the intent of the tests.. BTW -- I'm aware that OpenVZ is probably the most mature LXC solution out there.\nAs for docker vs Xen paravirt, that would be interesting as well and the information I presented clearly stated additional testing is warranted. I would encourage others to try such configurations and present results."}

{"prompt":"Does this mean that solar generates power when no one is willing to pay for it?\nI can't figure out these charts... probably because I am too stupid.\nI can't wrap my head around the consequences of having a power supply that doesn't follow demand.","completion":"Power supply already doesn't follow demand. Large scale power plants (coal, nuclear, even gas to some extent) run at a very steady output. It's a big system to get started & stopped, you need to get every part of the system to the proper temperature for quality steam, there are a bunch of lossy startup processes, etc. You can't just throttle them up and down at will. The timeline is longer than a day for most of them.\nBecause of that they sell electricity at a discount at night. Large industrial users will schedule their entire operations around this. For example ski mountains do their snowmaking at night because the power is the greatest expense (even more than labor) and the discount is enormous. I also believe that aluminum and steel foundries do some form of this.\nThe renewables change this dynamic a bit, but there are many loads that can be time shifted. I could imagine an electric car connected to the internet and plugged in all night at home and all day at work could optimize its charging cycle to match the lowest energy prices of the day. Of course this requires major changes to metering and billing, but there is no technical reason why it couldn't happen, it is all a business and infrastructure problem."}

That said, I'm a very experienced iOS dev, and I use XIBs as extensively as possible.

None of it can be easily redesigned for iPad or enhanced for the 4\" display. It'd take forever.\nUsing XIBs is also great for universal apps. I can instantiate the same controller with one XIB on iPad and another XIB on iPhone, and the layouts can be tailored to the platforms. It's wonderful when a client comes to you asking for an iPad version of their app, and you can duplicate the XIBs, scale them up, resize controls and swap out assets and go home early.\nOne thing that does suck about XIBs is that they ALWAYS cause merge conflicts. That part sucks and really needs to be addressed (at this point, Apple would probably have to write a diff tool for XIBs!)"}

{"prompt":"There are some people who argue anti-fungal and anti-bacterial activity are actually behind the effectiveness of a variety drugs that are not thought of as such. Statins, for one example, clearly do save people from having a second heart attack, even though the official cholesterol story justifying the drug is problematic. Some say the statins are actually killing off a fungal infection.\nThe article didn't even mention toxoplasmosis infection and links to mental illness and other behaviors.\nI don't think it's crazy to predict we're going to see more and more health and behavior problems directly linked to infectious agents over time. People bought this simple story that antibiotics saved us from all the infections 60 years ago.","completion":"Huh.

{"prompt":"> The notion that something needs to remain on-premise is really an Old World way of thinking and feels more like someone wanting control as opposed to there being a valid argument.\nNo, it's the business continuity way of thinking. Outsourcing commodities -- such as servers, virtual or otherwise -- is one thing.\nOutsourcing your core operational tools, software, and all your data is another matter entirely. Preferring SaaS at a company large enough to afford on-premise solutions is just nonsensical, and I expect it'll either blow up in his face, or just create a never-ending tax on end users who are constantly dealing with a mishmash of vendors, accounts, disappearing services, broken software, and instability.\nAt scale, stability and continuity is worth more than the opex\/capex costs of internal IT.","completion":"> Preferring SaaS at a company large enough to afford on-premise solutions is just nonsensical\nYes and no. First off, I don't think Netflix can afford to build the kind of infrastructure they're using -- certainly not without changing focus of their engineering resources. They famously do a lot of work to move data closer to the end users globally -- they're not \"just\" a US company. Essentially, they'd have to have an operation that would be \"qualitatively\" similar to AWS in order to be able to do what they do (and at a smaller scale overall, I think that would end up being quite expensive).\nI'd argue Netflix is one of the few companies I can think of where this \"all cloud all the time\" idea for infrastructure might actually make sense. I agree it's a big risk though -- and probably not good advice for most companies.\nIt would also appear that Netflix is planning on actually selling a product (video rental) and make money off that, rather than have that merely as a vehicle to drive other, sometimes tangential, innovation. That remains to be seen, of course."}

So an article with good items can rank higher than an article with more votes, but no items.\nRight now there isn't any time-component to the popular articles.

{"prompt":"If Valve's organization is simply to let employees fight it out thunderdome style to see who controls projects, culture, and direction, the organization should be grown by spinning off  completely new and independent businesses, not by hiring people.  Then the economics of free enterprise provides a true risk\/reward system.  With salaried employees rewards are capped.  Employees will only stick around until they discover that the real economy pays much better for hard work and good ideas and that the risks are basically the same: no income.\nThe \"we have no structure\" culture is disingenuous.  I don't buy the idea that most of the employees at valve don't want to dominate all the projects and their coworkers.  It is exactly the same anywhere.  You can't simply say 'we don't have managers' as obviously only certain people are going to have power of budget and final hiring decision.  Only certain people can sign documents.  Only when employees can expense anything they want and hire anyone they feel should be hired would a \"no managers\" description be appropriate.  You might say that this would never work, but it does work if each employee is given assistance or investment to spin off a new organization at any time, hire anyone, and spend money.","completion":"I don't buy the idea that most of the employees at valve don't want to dominate all the projects and their coworkers.\nI'm pretty sure I don't want to dominate my coworkers, so I find it easy to believe there are others who don't want that either.

{"prompt":"I wonder how the math works out versus a no-tip scenario?\nTips are money that doesn't come out of the restaurant owner's pocket. Restaurants tend to run on pretty thin margins, so let's treat this as a zero sum game and assume that any increase in wait staff wages is necessarily passed on to the consumer. I know next to nothing about what a waitress earns or how a restaurant is run, so I'd appreciate if anyone wanted to shoot holes in my reasoning here. I'm genuinely curious, so treat this as a proposition of method, rather than proof.\nFlorida minimum wage for tipped employees is $4.65\/hr. I live in Florida, so I'll go with that.\n$4.65 x 40 hrs a week x 52 weeks a year is $9,672.00\nI've known local waitresses who claim to take home around $30k a year (with tips).\n$30k annually works out to a wage of $14.42\/hr given the same 40 hrs x 52 weeks work schedule.\n$14.42 is about 3 times $4.65\nSo in a general sense, the restaurant owner would have to pay his wait staff (around) three times as much in order to meet their tipped wage. Not having run a restaurant, I have no idea how that would affect the price of a meal. Can anyone with more knowledge pick it up from here?","completion":"If, after increasing the wages, tipping is no longer 'required' of customers, the total price of a meal would stay roughly the same.  The owner would raise the price of the meal by about 15%, and pass that on to the servers, however tips would no longer be expected."}

{"prompt":"While I generally abhor taxes, I really like the idea of a financial transaction tax. It would effectively eliminate the profit margin for high frequency trading and remove a LOT of volatility from the markets. IMHO the market volatility is causing the average person to doubt the stability of the economy and hurting the entire ecosystem.\nEven a small transaction tax... Say, $1\/EUR per trade would remove the incentive for High frequency trading and encourage some more productive market dynamics. I mean, really, who wants to IPO in a market like this?

It's somewhat cheap (at most at semiconductors level price, not at astronomy or high energy physics level), enough to lots of companies to afford and maybe individuals (there is only a ceiling estimative to costs, there is no floor). And it has a huge potential for short term revenue.\nIf there is nobody researching that, I'm willing to bet that it's because nobody knows where to start. Not because anybody is blocking them."}

Then, draw line segments among hem and connect them to a graph. Then, the software cherry picks these commits according to what you've drawn and creates that branch. The need for a merge could be indicated as a red blinking light on a node. (And the not yet cherry-picked segments are grayed out.)

{"prompt":"This guy is completely mistaken.  It did at least occur to him that the two most successful web startups to date, Google and Yahoo, both did what he says startups shouldn't.

Names just don't matter much.

That's also true for startup investing generally.\nWhen we started YC, the returns seemed completely unpredictable. (They still do actually.)  What allowed us to do it was that we didn't care if we made money.","completion":"My thought on why that works for YC is that you are an educator. This thought is influenced not by your credentials but by students that I have known go into YC and what they seem to get out of it from an observers point of view. I don't think it should be about making money... it should be about education first, it would be nice if it at least covered everyone's costs (plus a little bit).\nA post on higher ed and incubators is what lead me down the incubator math question... I just need to finish up the original post."}

Most companies expect their\nhires to already have significant experience, but little are ready to train\nnew hires to match (future) needs. It's understandable where it comes from:\nemployees are not that loyal anymore, so any training would be an investment\nthat returns to somebody else.\nOn the other hand, times when companies were loyal to their employees are long\ngone, and this is pretty much why employees switch jobs so often nowadays."}

{"prompt":"Because socially punishing the NPEs takes the focus away from the real problem: punishing Congress for its failure to reform the laws causing a hemorrhage of lawsuits. The NPEs are effectively doing Congress' job by finding these loopholes; they're analogous to black-hat hackers who exploit a flaw in software that the developer fails to fix in a timely manner. In that example, this community historically hasn't vilified that hacker to the extent they vilify patent trolls. That's why I reacted strongly to your post.","completion":"If black hats are not doing it for social good, they deserve to be vilified as well.\nHere, the NPE's are only doing it for massive monetary gain to the detriment of innocents.\nIf the banks found a loophole in mortgage regulations that allowed them to take the houses of people who were paying, should we admire them for finding a bug, or vilify them for taking people's houses?\nYou seem (in this post and another) to think we should be doing the former.

{"prompt":"I'd like to argue from a Haskell backend perspective that monad transformers deserve exactly the complexity they expose. They give you a handle to factor side effects in sensible ways and to express that code requires exactly some set of effects and no others.\nIt is not always clear how to factor code which does not have this rigor into effect-typed form. It can be extraordinarily difficult to recognize what effects are being carried out in which parts of code at first\u2014especially if you haven't been forced into the discipline early. Thus, I find it unsurprising that you feel the translation effort is challenging.\nBut, coming from the other angle\u2014building things with well-defined effect typing from day zero and composing pieces atop one another to reach your final complexity goal\u2014works exceedingly well. Better, it forms a design which can be translated to untyped settings and retain its nice composition properties.\nWhich is to say not much more than: there is some logic to all that madness and once you're on the \"other side\" it's hard to judge these \"incredibly complex type idioms\" as anything other than useful and nearly necessary for sane code reasoning.\nI miss transformer stacks a lot when using other languages.","completion":"... said the monk, sitting cross-legged with an air of zen inner peace ; )\nI think it all boils down to considerations of idealism vs. realism, in the end, and yes, I have to admit, I managed to get a sort of big picture understanding of Yesod and its ORM, and it's definitely a cool design.

The problem is that you're trying to apply \"scientific conference\" rules to a HN \"cocktail party\" conversation, and it's not a good fit.

{"prompt":"The problem with this idea is that with current Bitcoin protocol implementation it will not work.

{"prompt":"I'm an Australian who recently became a Canadian Permanent Resident using a \"sponsorship\" process not unlike the H-1B. I've also had a few work visas for the USA, and applied for a H-1B (The rules changed before it could even be looked at).\nI personally think the idea of bringing in foreign labor is a very bad thing for the sponsoring country.\nFor example, where I live in Canada has a very high cost of living (very far North), but stupidly the minimum wage is lower than other parts of Canada. Many local businesses pay $14-$18 \/ hr as a starting wage for menial jobs, even though minimum is legally ~$10\/hr, because otherwise nobody would do the the job up here.\nWhen Walmart, McDonald's, KFC, Canadian Tire, etc. (who all have a pre-approved process with the govt. BTW) want to hire someone cheap, they just bring in a foreigner from a second world country. Those foreigners live 20 to a house and make $10\/hr. They can't work anywhere else, and if they quit they are deported. So those business can bring down the overall standard of living here by paying less than an average Canadian would actually be willing to do the job for.\nIf supply\/demand was allowed to run it's natural course, those companies would have to pay a little more ($14-$18\/hr), their profits would go down a little, but Canadians would be employed and the overall standard of living would not decrease.\nMake no mistake about it, bringing in foreigners lowers the quality of life for the original citizens, and only helps increase corporate profits.\n(Yes, I know I'm not supposed to bite the hand that feeds me, but I think I have a good perspective on the situation, given that it just happened to me)","completion":"You have just nailed it.  I used to work construction in western North Carolina.  The large crews paid far, far less than the crew I worked on.  Nobody who didn't live in a home where all the bedrooms were shared could make a living on the wages offered by these large crews.\nThe big argument is whether the cost savings passed onto the people buying the homes (construction is a notoriously low margin business) benefit the economy more\/less than the wage reductions for the people building them.  In this part of the country, the homes were huge mansions for the 1%ers.  I doubt it is a net gain for the economy, and certainly results in neighborhoods where there are not-quite developed world living conditions.\nBut what about produce?  American born citizens are not willing to pick produce for the wages currently offered, so farmers turn to illegal immigrants.  (Why pick vegetables all day when McDonalds pays more per hour?)  If farmers were forced to use Americans, they would have to pay significantly more per hour in wages.  This cost would be passed on to consumers.  Not sure how much more tomatoes would cost in this scenario, but it would be more.\nPersonally, I think I'd rather have significantly higher wages for a larger portion of the population combined with marginally higher prices for a huge portion of the population, rather than the opposite, which is in effect the WalMart model.\nWhen money gets concentrated into a smaller and smaller percentage of the population, you start to get similar effects to a Soviet style planned economy.  Rich idiots who delegate management of their money to the Morgan Stanleys of the world, while the working classes can't make enough to start a savings account and maybe start a business one day."}

{"prompt":"The prime example here is again in politics, slander is a tactic always taken by the right-wing parties, however when your claims are hollow and see through they can fail by record numbers. This happened in the UK when Labour gained the majority with Tony Blair, the conservatives launched a slander campaign that not only alienated voters from the conservative party but had no effect on keeping liberal voters out of the polling booths, they essentially handed parliament to Labour. The conservatives here in Canada keep playing the same tactics and have yet to get a majority through their tactics. Again the same could be seen with tactics used against Obama, but they were baseless claims and liberal voters came out in force, conservative voters staid at relatively the same levels but decreased vastly in percentage.\nOh come now, you can't think of any examples where left-wing parties have used slander against right-wing folks?

Will post it if it comes to me.)\nAs to your second argument: Are there other aspects of Japanese society that could influence their innovation that go beyond intellectual property? I'm not going to deny that IP protections could play a role in innovation, but I could certainly imagine two countries with identical IP regimes having RADICALLY different levels of innovation. (Education, culture, etc could all create positive impacts on innovation... and these effects may even outweigh any effect produced by an IP regime.)\nAre there any metrics for innovation as a whole? This would be an interesting thing to look into...","completion":"I don't know if this is the book you're thinking of, but \"Against Intellectual Monopoly\" by Michele Boldrin and David Levine has such arguments.\nIt's a very interesting book -- I'd recommend it to anyone interested in the subject, whatever their position."}

{"prompt":"How about after the first time a cyclist kills a driver in a collision?","completion":"When a bicyclist dies after contact with an automobile, do you suppose that the motorist goes the rest of their life in blissful contemplation of their survival of the incident? Do you suppose that no motorist is sensitive enough to have bad dreams after a near miss?\nIt could actually be useful to know which bicyclists are involved in the most near misses. It could even make the bicyclist change something, if they have more reports than average."}

{"prompt":"> Economies of scale make taxation efficient if you have publicly available goods, like water, or mass transit, or roads, or primary health care.\nOnly if providing said goods is done efficiently, which it never is.","completion":"It's not about efficiency, it's about need. These services need to stay at a basic level for everyone regardless of economic conditions. That's why you can't (fully) leave them to the market. However, hybrids between markets and governments can work very well. In the Dutch health insurance system, for example, the market is forced to provide basic health insurance to everyone, but is otherwise free to compete on price, service and additional products."}
{"prompt":"If we are, it should be called the Facebook Bubble. After their IPO when the stock lost half it's value, there was a severe market correction in VC as well. It got a lot harder to raise money. Now that the stock is up like 400% from its bottom, the money is flowing again. Want to know when the market will again correct? Just watch the price of FB. Or the new breed once they go public (Uber\/Airbnb\/Dropbox\/Square etc).","completion":"The FB stock dive was largely emotional investing and happens every time when you get an IPO of a brand the general public identify with. I saw it hit about 19 and bought, even if a bit too timidly. I don't think you can read too much into that initial cock up RE facebook's value."}

That has been the major issue with similar ideas as no mobile platform allows direct dom access to its webview widget.\nUnless I'm missing something the java ME runtime has very poor performance compared to other smartphone vms and doesn't have a JIT at all.

{"prompt":"Point for your friend.\nLong before this happened a US government cable analyzed Egypt and said that the military would do little to protect Mubarak as long as their economic interests were not threatened.  Right now the military is facing major disruption to its economic interests as long as the protests continue.  But if they transition to a new government, they can reduce the disruption.\nNow I can just see you saying, Economic interests?  What economic interests.  They are a military!  Which is entirely reasonable, but wrong.  The Egyptian military is somewhere between 1\/3 to 1\/2 of Egypt's economy.\nWhy?  Well when the Camp David accords brought about peace, Egypt no longer needed such a big military.  But they didn't want to make all of those men go into the private sector at once, that could destabilize the country.  So they found jobs for them.  For example lots of wonderful beaches no longer needed to be filled with military bases to repel a possible Israeli attack, so the military removed the bases, and built tourist resorts instead.  Which they ran.\nSo Mubarak is out.  He can't protect the military's commercial interests.  Whoever and whatever replaces him is fine as long as the military interests are maintained.  The changes can be extensive, so long as the country goes back to work and the military is free to return to making money.","completion":">so the military removed the bases, and built tourist resorts instead. Which they ran.\nAny sources for this? The Sinai peninsula did not have many military bases (certainly not Egyptian ones) on the coastline. Are you referring to another area?"}

{"prompt":"> The first one is mostly a problem with expressive power in the foreign function interface. Can you express what \"int read(int fd, char buf[], size_t len)\" means in the foreign function definition syntax? Rust's foreign function syntax isn't expressive enough to do that.[1] You can't tell Rust that \"len\" is the length of \"buf\". Being able to do that would help reduce the need for unsafe code. Most of the POSIX\/Linux API can be described with relatively simple syntax that allows you to associate size info with C arrays. (I once proposed this as an extension to C. It's technically possible but politically too difficult.)[2]\nThere's still a need for `unsafe`, since it's possible for the relationship to be described incorrectly. It's fundamentally not something the compiler can check, and hence requires `unsafe` conceptually (if not in practice).\nOne can regard wrapping FFI functions in safe interfaces as specifying the relationships between parameters.\n>  If you cast 4 bytes to a 32-bit unsigned integer, the result is always a valid 32-bit unsigned integer. Conversions like that should be explicit, but are not memory-unsafe.\nOnly a very small subset of types have the property that any bit-pattern is safe, essentially only primitives. So this seems like a rather limited way to reduce unsafety (instead of just writing a short library function once).","completion":"\"Only a very small subset of types have the property that any bit-pattern is safe, essentially only primitives.\"\nStructs which contain only primitives have that property.

What is at risk is either the $100-200mm to fix the options concerns for everyone, or at most, the breakup fee for this deal with Microsoft.  Skype probably could find another buyer, even without the Microsoft deal.\nMaybe Microsoft overpaid by 2x their nearest competitor.

Only time and amount of things to finish in my projects had stopped me from going on those meetings - but I will continue with the nearest opportunity.\nI didn't had a chance to use their products, but hearing the opinions about it - and knowing their attitude - I'd vote with my both hands if having the opportunity to do so.\nGreat job, Guys!"}
{"prompt":"Interesting. Any other recommendations on how to secure regex's that take in user input in Ruby\/Rails?","completion":"First of all you should think hard before taking regexes from users. Even if you do it correctly you'll still (presumably) need to search over your entire dataset, instead of doing something more lightweight like rely on SQL indexes. Use it with care.\nYou should use a regex engine that's explicitly designed to take potentially hostile input. Like the Plan9 engine, or Google's re2 engine which powers Google Code Search.\nYou can also just use Ruby's dangerous PCRE engine if you do something like forking off another process with strict ulimits which executes the regex for you. Then you can just kill it if it starts running away with your resources. Look into how e.g. evaluation bots that work on the popular IRC channels on FreeNode are implemented. POE::Component::IRC::Plugin::Eval on the CPAN is a good example."}

Therapy and psychiatric drugs have, however, been demonstrated time and again to yield better treatment outcomes for most people with mental illness (i.e. diagnosed disorder.)\nSo I guess what I don't get is how you think your claims and allegations and are justified.\nAs far as I can tell, no one is denying your experience.\nWe are, however, saying that your experience is probably not generalizable, given what is known.\nThe way I see it, lexicalscope is obviously saying that while it is true that \"most people don't have hard-core mental illness\", we should avoid inadvertently instilling the \"it's probably nothing\"-attitude because this leads to people ignoring warning signs\/not getting help, especially given that it is already happening with the current lack of knowledge and stigma surrounding mental illness.\nWere the situation different, this would not be such a big deal.\nIn short, their issue is with the likely result of what you suggest.","completion":"\"maybe it just reads that way to me\"\nBingo.

{"prompt":"Those two consequences you predict are entirely contradictory.  Less educated people will be pushed out of the workforce, but for some reason people will also disregard education that would increase their employability?  Say what?\nLiving wage does have a specific definition - it is a minimum subsistence wage, that takes into account the cost of living for a various area as well as various things that are necessary to be able to work (eg child care, transportation, and medical coverage).  It does not budget time or money for any entertainment or leisure time, or any long-term financial planning such as retirement or savings.\nSo in short it's a minimum wage, except a minimum wage that's actually based on the immediate day-to-day costs needed to keep you working at your job.  In fact it's really less political than the minimum wage itself, since the minimum wage is just an arbitrary number someone chose - one that's usually low enough to require the government to subsidize businesses who employ minimum-wage workers, through various social programs.  Why is the minimum wage currently $7.25 instead of the $15 equivalent it was in the 70s?  We simply haven't legislated an increase.\nCan you change what costs are considered essential to keeping you working?  Sure, and those do change over time.  70 years ago you wouldn't have had to include child-care costs since you'd have a stay-at-home wife to care for them.  And indeed such things should change when justified by conditions on the ground - we no longer live in an economy of 1-income households, and it's not just foolish to pretend we do - it's harmful.\nI assure you that Americans demonstrate ample resistance to perceived increases in the living standards of the poor, it's unnecessary to preemptively rule out any changes down the road.","completion":"I agree with regard to inflation.  That should be taken into consideration.\nI don't see the contradiction.  Today, if we move min wage to 20, undereducated people will get pushed out by people with two years of coll.\nIn the long term, if we increase min wage to make it a livable wage by which you can raise a family, what would motivate a 16 yo to further studies and become the two year comm cool grad?

{"prompt":"After seeing the first, extremely slick demo of meteor, I was, as I believe a lot of people were, extremely excited to see where the project would go.  Then came the funding, and some twelve or sixteen months of development, and I finally decided to dive in.\nI really wanted to like it.  I was predisposed to do so.\nBut from the very beginning, I was confronted with something I consider a deal breaker.  While I am wary and generally disinclined toward the increasingly popular pattern of curl an installation script and pipe into sh, in this case it is not only skeptical, it is downright ludicrous.  Why would I, nay anyone, want to install an npm package this way?  Should not the installation instructions simply be `npm install -g meteor`?  And what if I need to work on multiple meteor projects with different versions?  Surely there is support for adding it to your package.json file, but why is this not the primary means of installation and well documented?\nMaybe I am being overly sensitive to these issues, but it really baffled me that the very foundation upon which a meteor project is predicated would be contradictory to the typical node workflow.  I will probably try meteor to spike out a project at some point in time, but I do not foresee myself using it extensively in the near future.","completion":"Meteor is a lot more than an npm package. For example, if you type these four commands..\n$ curl https:\/\/install.meteor.com | \/bin\/sh; meteor create myapp; cd myapp; meteor\nyou're up and running with a complete stack including MongoDB, node, the dozen-ish core packages that make up the Meteor pubsub and realtime templating stack, and the 'meteor' build tool (which can do things like compile coffeescript and less, generate source maps, minify your production code, and provide a realtime development environment where whenever you save a file your app updates in your browser.)\nAs for versioning, it's actually got a great way of doing that. Each of your Meteor projects is locked to a specific Meteor release version (similar to an Ubuntu release, it's a release-engineered snapshot of the Meteor core packages), which you can set with the `meteor update` command. And this has automatic `npm shrinkwrap` integration so that if you use npm packages alongside Meteor packages, everyone on your team is always running exactly the same versions of all of the code in your app. The Meteor tools automatically handle all the work of downloading any needed Meteor versions and keeping them installed side-by-side on your laptop, using the correct one for a given project, and notifying you of available updates."}

That hardly seems worth analyzing. Exactly what you do with that money is a minor detail compared to the fact that it's coming in from the outside.

I also used to collect late 1800's typewriters but they were taking up too much room.\nWhat amazes me about antique tech is that the ergonomics and the engineering were inter-meshed.  Today we can put a button and a chip anywhere so the design and engineering are quite separate as long as one accommodates the other.  But if you look at for example a mechanical typewriter, the entire thing is engineered to function in an ergonomic sense as well.  Not only does the lever have to work, it has to require not too much force to activate, strike the ribbon with enough force to transfer ink, return to position quickly, avoid the other levers in their paths of motion, while all being arranged in such a way as to fit our big meaty hands comfortably.

{"prompt":"Here's another solution:\nRespect the wisdom of markets. Allow corrections to take place and don't bury malinvestment under the rug only for it rear it's ugly head worse later on by acting as if you have a better intuition on what the price of money should be.\nMost people accept the virtue of free markets. Yet many don't see that the actions the Fed has been taking destroys the concept of a market by artificially supplementing supply or demand in an unbounded way based on a perceived sense of greater understanding.\nThe problem is it's really hard for most of these policy makers to build a platform based on \"Let's do nothing and let the markets correct themselves\". In such complex domains like an economy the action bias is very real, problematic, and the best thing to eliminate if you want to renormalize markets.","completion":"The value of money is completely determined by fed actions and allowing it to drift in detrimental value paths would be the farthest thing from respecting the markets. Economy wide \"malinvestment\" is not a thing. It entails that a person living off of others is more productive than a person working. It's nonsense.\nAlthough money should be just an intermediary tool for trade and negotiation, an artificial asset that is neutral, in the short run this intrinsically valueless paper can distort the markets, even if it has predictable value, but only if it is manipulated into being a store of value that has a better risk adjusted return than private market stores of value.\nPaper money has no intrinsic value in itself. If the fed keeps it predictably devaluing fast enough, always moving it towards its intrinsic value, it acts as a very useful enabler of trade by creating a unit of measurement for value and medium of exchange.\nBut unfortunately, for fiat to enable trade, it also has to artificially be made into a store of value. If this paper is made into a store of value that retains value better than private stores of value (such as stocks, bonds, or just stockpiles of stuff), it jams the markets for private stores of value. It turns savers into accumulators of pieces of paper or numbers in accounts instead of being holders of things that are backed by economic activity and wealth creation. It becomes a subsidy from investors, entrepreneur, job creators and workers to holders of pieces of paper. It is the worst kind of subsidy\n because it blocks wealth and welfare creation.\nThe only way for central banks to allow private markets to function properly, is to get money out of the way by making sure it always devalues fast enough that it doesn't overly displace private stores of value that are backed by real economic activity."}

I'd have several Google TVs already if that was possible.\nThere's seems to be a more restricted culture around Google TV. The source code isn't available so there's no no-name boxes from small OEMs to stir up the low-end of the market. (Although you could argue that they can stick to vanilla Android but that won't help the platform reach or brand-recognition of Google TV)\nI agree about the price-point but who apart from Vizio is producing a $99 box?

I'd much rather we explore new incentive systems which are oriented specifically toward knowledge work. We already do this in the form of new business models: commoditizing your components, freemium, gift economies, etc. But there is still a lot of unexplored space in creating new ways to profit from the creation of data, either by creating new business models, or drafting new social conventions (government-backed or otherwise).","completion":"The devil is in the details:\nHow do you propose we give someone the means to make a living writing books, for instance?

This might work ok for saturday morning cartoons, where there are toys to be purchased, but it's a fairly limited model, especially for most authors, who don't have much else to sell.\n* Freemium means that you still make people pay for the goods and they are not allowed to freely copy them.\n* \"Gift economies\" is very hand wavy and, by and large, does not put food on the table as far as I can tell.\nI suspect that there are new business models, but ultimately, it comes down to a question of scarcity.

{"prompt":"Isn't the \"without a warrant\" part of this story kind of a huge red herring? We're discussing subpoenas, not actual searches.\nA subpoena is part of pre-trial discovery.

The target of the subpoena has recourse: challenge the subpoena in court.\nI see clearly the concern about criminal law enforcement agencies casting too wide a net by relying on \"relevance to investigation\" instead of \"probable cause\". But the Wired story makes it seem like the biggest problem with administrative subpoenas is that they're extrajudicial. It's obviously the case that judges are going to tend to side with the government in these cases --- not because they're in cahoots, but because in the overwhelming majority (not ALL of the cases, just the majority), the government is (a) not abusing process, and (b) acting in the clear service of the public good.\nThere's no such thing as an \"extrajudicial subpoena\", is there?","completion":"As the editor of the story, I can say the point of the story is that Congress has given out the administrative subpoena very widely and there's almost no supervision whatsoever of them. You blithely conclude that \"the overwhelming majority\" does not include \"abusing process\" and are \"in the clear service of the public good.\"\nBut you're just making that up. The point of the story is that this is a VERY powerful tool, especially since the subpoena targets are often THIRD parties who have no incentive or desire whatsoever to fight them (with the notable exception of Twitter -- thanks @amac).\nThe only reporting that's required by Congress is on anti-terror subpoenas, and the number of those fell only AFTER two required Inspector General reports found the FBI routinely violating the law, conspiring with AT&T and Verizon and going after reporters.\nWhile your optimism about the authorities seems genuine, I can't see at all how there's any data to support it."}

Since those files are being accessed as memory they consume space from the 4 GB of address space on a 32-bit platform, but don't take up physical memory (except insofar as their contents is cached in disk buffers).\nThat's one thing that's often misunderstood with the 32-bit limitation -- address space is limited; modern \"32-bit\" CPUs have used 36-bit addressing internally for quite some time, meaning they can address 64 GB rather than 4 GB of RAM (http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Physical_Address_Extension).\nBecause of the address space limitations you also don't have a full 4 GB to work with inside of a process on 32-bit platforms -- if you try to allocate a 3.5 GB block of memory it will usually fail because there's no contiguous  block of address space available, even if there's 3.5 GB of unused memory.  Typically the Linux kernel reserves 1 GB of address space for itself, and user space reserves a block for memory mapped I\/O devices as well.\nThere's a pretty good article explaining some of this here:\nhttp:\/\/kerneltrap.org\/node\/2450\nNow, all of that said, I'm not disagreeing with your advice -- just noting that there are some (mostly corner-) cases where you do need the address space, but may not need the physical memory."}

So, I shrunk the \"What\" and increase \"Less Boilerplate.\"\n2. Too control the eyeflow from top to bottom, I increase the size of the navigation bar.\n3. I increased repetition by changing the color of the header to white,the text to white and the separator in the navigation bar to white.\n4.To highlight the \"What\" more I indent the text under it. And also set the text under it to be the same font size.  There is no conflict here, since the header \"What\" is already highlighted alot.\n5.

Every single one of them has goals for their districts\/states and they get fired (not reelected) if they fail more than the public likes.\nIf government seems so inefficient and difficult to get things done, it's often because members of congress have conflicting goals so getting anything done is difficult.  This isn't an accident, it's how the system is supposed to work.\n> There is punishment for incompetence.\nUsually, but as we're clearly seeing now government and business are so tightly interwoven in the modern world that execs knowingly abuse the government and do things that would be bad if they didn't know they'd be bailed out by their buddies in government who they paid to have elected.\n> I suggest that firing the current crop of executives\nNot going to happen and you know it.","completion":"There is a qualitative difference between the vague and often contradictory corpus of promises that a politician makes on the campaign stump and the clear contractual obligations that a corporation owes to its creditors.

{"prompt":"In theory, it should be reasonable for a stable linux distro release to lock in stable gem versions that have been tested at the same level as the distro.\nIt's just the case that for Ruby the library ecosystem is being developed at a fast enough pace that few want to settle for gem versions that are 6-18 months old.\nIf the debian ecosystem was actually functioning as designed, someone would create a trusted apt repo with well tested updates that would perhaps be 3 months behind bleeding edge.  This would likely be adequate for most ruby projects.  It's my impression that the python community is better supported in the debian world.\nSuggestion:  the gem utility should be able to generate deb and rpm packages with proper version numbers, and the utility should also have a setting to \"pull from distro repository\" to allow things like bundler to be compatible with apt... this would allow\/entail letting multiple gem versions live side by side, which would likely seem like a distro-smell to many sysadmins (though it isn't one).","completion":"In my experience the Debian problem goes way beyond not having the most recent gems; they broke Rubygems, so that things like Bundler don't work.\nNo matter what they thought was reasonable, they should have just left gems alone."}

Personally, I prefer this situation to the alternative: knowing exactly how and what to do, but not even bothering to keep a manned spaceflight capability or high-energy particle physics research facility funded.\nAs for what Turkey can do to get on the right track, I think the first thing that needs to happen is the expansion of homegrown technologies. It seems every user group or startup weekend type event I've seen advertised is almost exclusively sponsored and\/or run by Microsoft.

{"prompt":"If variables don't mutate, all it means is that the memory location that stores the value of that variable is guaranteed to never change. Thus, if you reassign that same-named variable, it actually points to a new memory location with the new value. That is what \"rebinding\" is vs. \"mutating.\" The advantage of this is concurrency, etc. etc. The disadvantage is you have to have good GC since you'll be doing a lot more garbage collection. It may LOOK like it's changing a variable, but it's not- the variable merely points to a new memory location.\nOther languages, like Ruby, do not work this way. If you reassign an instance variable, the memory that is storing that value actually does change.\nHere, compare the same sequence of operations in Ruby and Elixir, first Ruby:\n    bash>> irb\n    >> a = {a: 5}\n    => {:a=>5}\n    >> b = a\n    => {:a=>5}\n    >> a[:a] = 10\n    => 10\n    >> b\n    => {:a=>10}\n\nand now Elixir:\n    bash>> iex\n    Erlang\/OTP 18 [erts-7.1] [source] [64-bit] [smp:8:8] [async-threads:10] [hipe] [kernel-poll:false] [dtrace]\n\n    Interactive Elixir (1.1.0) - press Ctrl+C to exit (type h() ENTER for help)\n    iex(1)> a = %{a: 5}\n    %{a: 5}\n    iex(2)> b = a\n    %{a: 5}\n    iex(3)> a = %{a | a: 10} # updates a mapping\n    %{a: 10}\n    iex(4)> b\n    %{a: 5}\n\nNotice how b's value changed in Ruby, but not in Elixir. In both cases, the hash was updated.","completion":"> If variables don't mutate\nI think we are talking about two different things when we say \"variables\". When I say \"variable\" I mean x, y, a, b etc. That is the variable. It has a value, you can see it in the shell (repl) or when printing it. Look at what happens to variable x:\n   iex(1)> x=1\n   1\n\n   iex(2)> x=2\n   2\n\nIt was 1 then 2. It changed. Mutation is a synonym for \"change\". I think it is a pretty simple concept. Did the framework create a new memory cell, put a 2 in there and now x behind the scene dereferences that. Did it update the old cell in place. Was it on the stack?  That's not the point. The point is x now has a new value. x is a variable that means variable x mutated.\nCompare to Erlang:\n   1> X=1.\n   1 \n   \n   2> X=2.\n   ** exception error: no match of right hand side value 2\n\nYou can't mutate variable X. variable X is immutable. Again, I think that is pretty clear and simple.\nWhat you showed in your example is how data is immutable in Elixir but not in Ruby.\n> The advantage of this is concurrency, etc. etc.\nActually most data, except larger binaries, are copied between processes anyway. So concurrency advantage is mostly theoretical. In the future they could be switched to reference counting for other things. But that is a hidden implementation detail anyway."}

{"prompt":"A small personal peeve: it doesn't make sense to say that Sudoku is NP-hard, as the linked post does (or NP-complete). First of all, this benchmark (as far as I can tell) uses only traditional 9x9 puzzles, of which there is a finite number. Problems with a finite input space are trivial from the point of view of complexity theory; in order to talk about any kind of completeness or hardness results, you need to generalize Sudoku by defining NxN problems in some way.\nMoreover, once you define NxN Sudoku (the generalization is easy), you need to pick the problem for which you want to prove a hardness result. The decision problem is typically defined as \"given an instance of a problem, determine if there is a solution\". For Sudoku, you would need to decide if a partial grid can be completed to a full grid, i.e. if the given puzzle is solvable. This has been proven to be NP-complete. However, this is not how the puzzle is usually done, including in this benchmark: you are given a puzzle which is known to have a solution, and the solution is known to be unique. You then need to find the solution. It's been shown that such a Sudoku problem is equivalent to the unambiguous satisfiability problem (given a logical formula which has a unique variable assignment that satisfies it, find that assignment). Now the unambiguous satisfiability problem is not known to be NP-complete when phrased as a decision problem.\nAnyway, don't just throw around terms like \"NP-hard\". :)\nEDIT: edited \"unique satisfiability\" to \"unambiguous satisfiability\". I believe this is the correct terminology for the \"promise\" version of the problem which I described, and to which Sudoku is equivalent. (The unique satisfiability problem is \"decide if a logical formula has exactly one solution\", where you are not told if it has more than one, none, or just one).","completion":"Finding and understanding computational algorithms is part of my daily work. I know what time complexity means. By saying NP-hard, I mean an NxN sudoku cannot be solved in time polynomial to N.\nMost sophisticated sudoku solving algorithms, including mine, do not assume the grid has a solution or one solution. They test and give all possible solutions. I am really trying to solve an NPC problem.\nThat said, your comment still tells me something I do not know - you seems to say that given a sudoku that is known to have one solution, there may be polynomial algorithms. This reminds me of someone who left a comment in my blog, saying that if the solution is unique, at each step there are at most two choices with the exact cover matrix. He couldn't prove that, but his program run happily on tens of thousands of Sudokus without problems. This does not necessarily solve sudoku in polynomial time, but may make solvers faster for unique sudokus."}

{"prompt":"I had this bug once about 10ish years ago when I was still a windows dev. Creating a 2nd window on a thread with a window already but then pumping it's main loop on a background thread can cause this. If you do that the loops get hooked to each other regardless of the thread pumping it. The child window has to wait until the parent window forwards the event for the second thread to pop it off. A mouse move will send a WM event and keep the child windows loop on the other thread spinning. My WM_TIMER on the child window was stuck as well.\nIt happened to me because I had a hidden window on the background thread to get WM events for USB disconnect and reconnect messages from the system. The bug report was funny. \"Connecting USB data collection probe doesn't work unless the user moves the mouse after connecting.\" and the follow up bug \"Data collection only works when moving the mouse.\"","completion":"The rule of thumb as I always heard it is that a window is \"owned\" by the thread that created it. You can send and post messages from a different thread, but do much else and you're asking for trouble.

Does that actually work? Wouldn't you see the messages on the original thread's pump too? I thought the way it worked is each thread with ui objects has a queue, and SendMessage et al. will insert into the owning thread's queue. It took me a while to parse what you are saying, did you pass the hwnd into GetMessage from the other thread and that somehow convinced it to peek at another thread's queue?"}
{"prompt":"A prison is a place where people are deprived of liberties.  A society can justify depriving people of liberties.

If a higher prison population turns into a financial incentive, there is no incentive to help inmates or even reduce recidivism.\nThis is especially true when you consider how many minor offenses can send people to jail in the US. It is also interesting to consider that when slavery was abolished, many plantations turned into for-profit prisons; or that the incarceration rate of the US is the highest in the world.","completion":"The government delivers citizens into the hands of private management all the time: required insurance policies, training programs, licensure, etc. Mandating that every obligatory service be not only funded, but implemented, by government would extend its rolls of employees, budgets, laws and legal complexity, competencies, and requisite voter knowledge beyond any reasonable possibility.\nYou seem to be ascribing a negative to the mere profit focus of a private company, rather than the outcome. We could do the same for insurance, medical practice, automobiles, plane travel, lodging, and everything else important; but we don't, because private companies in the open market perform better.\nWould you then deliver everything important into the hands of government monopoly, despite everything we know about the benefits of competition, for the moral premise rather than results? And if you think the results weigh against private prison companies, might we restructure the government\/private arrangement before nuking wholesale the notion of the market?\nWRT the incarceration rate, I'd have to see something linking that to private companies running prisons, rather than problems with the justice system itself.\nConsider the abysmal performance of government-run schools, among others, as a counterpoint."}

So they get confused because their domain is the programming language, so they don't feel like they're spending their mind power on two different things.

They, too, can't understand why people solving a hard concurrent-data-structure problem wouldn't want to spend time thinking about expressing their ideas elegantly through types.\nBoth of these groups have one thing in common: expendable energy to spend thinking about programming language concepts.

Dictionaries often attach information to meanings like \"archaic\" or \"frequently misused as\" or \"frequently confused with\".\nFor example, a dictionary can and should add a note to \"their\" saying \"frequently confused with they're and there\".  There's absolutely nothing wrong with that.

{"prompt":"I don't pursue it to the \"ultimately\" stage -- it's a moderate belief, that only holds true within certain boundaries. I have no plan to skate off the edge of the slippery slope. What's more, my opinion rests on further subjective opinions like what constitutes \"well-off\", what constitutes \"a good lifestyle\", and dozens of other terms which could each spawn a debate.\nThat said, I think most people would agree that there is a degree of wealth at which some amount of it can safely be considered superfluous to the needs -- including the entire hierarchy, unless one must self-actualize as an airplane collector -- of one person.

{"prompt":"Sure, but if it's against school policy, the school has the right to expel you. Coursera is not taking the public code down, the owner is, at the coercion of the school. The student is making a value decision: continue the course or take my code down. If you can't play by the rules, you can't be in the game.\nI think there's a unique opportunity for GitHub here. They could give an educational license to verified students in college\/high-school\/on-line schools. For the duration of their class, they can have as many private repos as they like. When the semester ends, you've got a week to grab your code before it goes public, like a free account. First, it would get students used to GitHub and they would clammer for it in the workplace because they love it so much; Second, it would position GH as a great supporter of education.","completion":"BitBucket offers free private repos.\nhttps:\/\/bitbucket.org\/plans\nEdit- Apparently BitBucket launched a new version of their site only moments after sharing this link.

Sure, those situations are probably signs of badly constructed sentences (eg, nested lists or lists as an aside[1]), but still! The difference is that if I have a list \"a,b and c\" which is itself followed by a comma \"(a,b and c),d\" - to me, it looks like \"a,(b and c),d\" - but if there is a comma before the \"and\" it doesn't: \"(a,b,and c), d\" - the \"and\" now implies that c is the last item of the list, making the nesting obvious.\nJust something that popped into my mind just now.\n[1] Example: \"I find lists which are followed by a comma, such as morning, noon and night, look awkward\" vs \"I find lists which are followed by a comma, such as morning, noon, and night, look awkward\" - the first one reads as if \"noon and night\" is one item in the list, the second one as two (with night as the final item)."}

No hard ship date with a command to abandon anything that wouldn't fit (real artists ship, Copland did not ship).\nMuch has been made of how little Jobs contributed to the original Macintosh.

You can imagine it resulting in some of the problems associated with domain naming: name squatting and legal fights over trademarks.\nArguably the name of a project is a trademark, and no one has permission to use it unless you grant them that permission.  Just because you license the copyright to your code under an OSS or Free Software license, does not automatically entail granting a license to the trademark on the name.\nIMO, this is one thing that makes Github a bit of a legal tar-pit... it's trivially easy to fork a repo, but nothing makes (or even encourages) you to change the name, or make it clear that your repo isn't the \"official\" Project Foobar.  So far it seems that most people just take a \"don't ask, don't tell, don't care\" sort of approach to that, but I have a hunch it's going to get somebody burned eventually."}

So the NSA would get your Google Location data, but only if you were giving to Google. As far as I know, the NSA hasn't made someone collect it anyway.\nLegally, the heart of the NSA legal basis is the 3rd party doctrine that states that data held by a third party isn't private. It would be a very illegal search to have Microsoft invade your privacy under NSA order.\nOf course, there is also some risk that the NSA or some other party goes rouge as does it anyway. But you have that problem with essentially all software and hardware.\nYou'd have to compile your own OS from source code you inspected thoroughly. And even then, the NSA is almost without a doubt sitting on linux 0-days.\nAnd literally (and I don't mean figuratively) nobody knows whats on all the firmware in all the components in all your devices.\nThe risk of being an NSA target is super low. The harm in being a false positive target is pretty low too. Even if the NSA hacked your windows install, they won't find any plans to blow up the Sears tower and then go about their business.\nCompared to risk that a car accident will destroy your existance, who cares about this tiny risk.\nI probably wouldn't windows if I were a KGB agent, but other than that, why worry."}

{"prompt":"I've started several companies and also been a first employee (and so have a number of my family members), and I've experienced multiple situations (and seen others second hand) where subsequent employees contributed more than at least one of the founders. This includes everything from founders being unmistakable liabilities to even one case where a 50% owning founder ended up doing quite literally nothing but playing online poker and silently attending meetings for his entire tenure, which lasted half a decade.\nThe problem with the issue is what constitutes \"deserving\" of a larger share of equity. Obviously there are different perspectives on this, but in terms effort, there certainly are many cases where employees eclipse founders. I literally just finished a conversation 30 minutes ago with a c-level exec about how the one founder of her company who is still present (there were two) never actually did anything other than give talks and never had anything to do with operations or strategy.\nEven in the case of taking on risk, a founder with enough personal wealth and\/or strong professional network that failure doesn't severely impact them is certainly not taking as much risk as an employee who is living paycheck to paycheck.\nIn short, I've seen more than enough cases where strong, effective employees worked harder, took more risk, and contributed more to the success of the company than one of the founders. I'm not sure by what metric the founder \"deserved\" more equity in those cases besides being there from the beginning.","completion":"Of course when you take the worst possible scenarios it doesn't look good."}
{"prompt":"What I was trying to say in the original discussion (and what I'll try to reiterate here) is that the story is relying on a single source: government press releases.

It is clearly not farfetched to believe the military would release false information or propagate misinformation.  (See anything WikiLeaks has released re:US Military).\nAs for \"The simplest explanation is almost always right\", I would tend to agree with you on matters of science.  But in the tense and complex political landscape of US foreign policy in the Middle East, the true story is almost certainly going to be far more complex then what will be presented in the news.  If your final judge of accuracy is simplicity, then I can fool you easily by telling you a simpler lie then the one you are currently believing.","completion":"I don't think anyone here would disagree with you that we shouldn't solely trust one source, but that's nothing to build an intelligent discussion around.\n\"I don't believe the story this reporter wrote because I don't trust the source(s)\" is a totally valid opinion, but anything further than that is just a \"What-if\" fest unless someone wants to put forth a specific alternate hypothesis, or question specific facts from the article.\n\"You shouldn't believe in this story because I don't trust the source(s)\" adds a little info (especially with a \"here's why\"), but in the case of something as complicated as a government is probably just going to cause a flame war, _even if you're right_."}

They move value around.","completion":"Allocating money (or time or work hours) is a necessary step in creating anything. I don't think the hard nosed approach to estimating value is very useful. You could say that only the actual workers producing something physical create value, but at the end of the day, all people in the chain contributed to it.\nConsider a scenario where you have two alternatives: you could ship shit from one pile to another for 5 hours, or you could spend 5 hours brewing beer.  Suppose the worker has no idea whatsoever as to which activity is more benefitial, so the finance guy decides whether 5 hours will be spent on moving shit around, or brewing beer. Suppose the value of beer is much greater than moving shit - I think at the end of the day the finance guy will have contributed to bringing the beer into existence.\nI know that there is this school of economics that tries to define value by the amount of (physical) work that went into it, but it really doesn't make much sense. You don't create value simply by doing something physical - it has to be useful, too. So I think the usefulness of the end result is a much better estimator of value."}

There's no absence of information on either side, unless you just chose to ignore what you signed.\nThe ISP is providing you connectivity to their network, generally through a heavily subsidized connection, for you to get 'Internet' access.  Discriminating between business customers and home users is something that occurs in many industries (see wholesale\/retail).  You get a significantly reduced price as a home user for reduced connectivity options\/flexibility.\nIf you want or need the flexibility, you pay more and get a neutral connection, where they will (generally) happily route you whatever you need and can justify.\nIt's not an invalid contract, and what was suggested is fraud at it's most basic level.

{"prompt":"The definition of 'freak' for most people is \"people who don't have sensible regard to norms\".

American has the only non-stop flights between those two cities, and any connection is going to add at least 2 hours to your travel time (based on a quick glance).

Yet the Craigslist transition has not taken anything away from society.  Those that lost their jobs are not now contributing less to society -- their jobs would be glorified make-work in a post-Craigslist society.

If they are using proxies, that is much easier because you can just block them all without any worry of accidentally blocking real consumers (in addition to the fact that you can also file abuse complaints).  I think at Thumbtack we blocked all AWS IPs, a good deal of foreign IPs, in addition to the specific IPs of people who were abusively crawling.\nAt the same time, the onus shouldn't be on QVC to have to block this, result.ly should either be a good citizen or have to face a lawsuit.

It could be the teaching method.  I've experienced first hand that some people who seemed to not \"get it\" for some subject could in fact understand it quite well when it was presented in a way they understood (perhaps they didn't see the relevance, perhaps they didn't have the proper frame of reference to understand the normal explanation or a poor grasp of those references).\nFor me it's just too simple to say \"everything's fine, those people are just too stupid.  Bad genetics\".  What if it's not?  Then we're throwing away a lot of potential unnecessarily.

Stating that my use of Apple harms you because of my \"support\" of their business and legal decisions may not be entirely false; however, it's a) unreasonable to expect consumers to know about the operational choices of every company they do business with and b) also helpful because it promotes competition in the market. Again, your points had merit, but so does the other side of the equation.\nThe unfortunate reality of being a publicly-traded US company is that you are more or less legally required to try to litigate your competition out of existence if the numbers support it. This instance is unfortunate because Apple was granted some patents that they should not have been, and there was inept jury in deciding to uphold them (never mind the fact that it was a jury-based trial at all).

{"prompt":"The idea that >20% savings rates are not \"realistic\" is a serious mindset problem.  Almost anyone on Hacker News with a paying job (i.e. not an early-stage no-funding startup) should easily be able to save much more than that.  Sure, saving two-thirds of your income might be out of reach, and even the 20% advice is better than most sites that often say 5-10%, but consider carefully whether you can increase it and retire years earlier (or become effectively retired, in the sense that you no longer depend on having an income).\nEDIT: \"Almost anyone on Hacker News\". Yes, 20% would be significantly harder on minimum wage.","completion":"Even if you're a \"rich\" software engineer, the advice is  overstated.  You need to make a lot of money (or be really lucky in the stock market) to have a 66% savings rate lead to any sort of real retirement in 10 years.\nSay I make $100k gross per year.  That's a very nice salary for a new grad engineer -- the kind of person who might take this ten-year-retirement advice to heart.  Roughly 1\/3 of that income goes to taxes, so I'm actually taking home $66k per year.  If I save 66% of that, I'm saving ~$44k per year.  These numbers can shift a little depending on where you live, how you save, etc., but they're not going to change by a huge amount.\nMultiply that $44k by 10 years, and you're not even at half a million dollars.  That's not retirement money (unless perhaps your \"retirement\" is to continue to live off of $20k\/year indefinitely and die young from eating too much ramen).\nThe other half of the equation is finding investments that return a reasonable yield without betting the farm on timeframes <= 10 years.  In this market, that's nearly impossible.  Your choices are stocks and bonds (which are fine, but are risky on anything less than a ten-year window), or investments that don't yield anything."}

{"prompt":"Your lament is certainly warranted. It has taken two decades for the desktop to arrive in the browser.

We've seen early prototypes of SPA and Flash web applications during this time but the costs were very high. It is lower now since MV* arrived in the browser and we have the tech to replicate a desktop app in the browser but with limitations which is being eroded thanks to thin clients like nw.js, electron, etc (even NPAPI was too thick).\nMuch as creating a desktop was impossible for early versions of Windows for the average joe, the introduction of a UI\/Software builder from MS lowered that barrier of entry significantly but as you know, things moved away from isolated desktop apps to the web and we had to figure it out all over again.\nI think the front-end development will eventually be commoditized to the point where somebody could use a tool to generate clean, tested, plumbing code. Back-end is also seeing some of this, particularly with automatic REST api generation tools and write-once-for-both-front-and-backend would be a good catalyst.\nSpeculation at best but we are in for some interesting times ahead.","completion":"The formula is: new operating-system\/vm\/browser > new programming language > new libraries > new ui builder :). Choose any one and re-create everything that comes after. Rinse and repeat en-millennium.\nAt some point in the next 10 years, a browser vendor will put out a new language that will have revolutionary new features like a 'built in type system' and 'compile time errors', and users will be amazed at how their browser now only uses .1% of their CPU to load a page and wonder why this language wasn't created sooner.

Isn't the goal to provide basic living for people who can't provide for themselves instead of letting them die on the streets?\nI'm proposing unlimited baskets of goods purely for predictable cost reasons, it doesn't really matter if they gamble them away, although I find it unlikely they'd find any takers since everyone has access to the same baskets.\nWelfare is a cost, basic income doesn't seem like it would satisfy that cost in the most efficient way."}
{"prompt":"I'd second the splitting of self into an analytic side and a  emotional side being helpful as a short term coping mechanism, but I would caution against taking it too far. It is great as a short term buffer against letting your state get the better off you, but at the end of the day you're still depressed and viewing everything in some way through that lens of depression.  Even if you're able to recognize the cognitive biases that introduces, your self esteem is still in the gutter and you still feel that cold depressed feeling.  As far as other not-meds things that help, exercise, a regular schedule, good diet, and avoiding drugs (especially alcohol\/narcotics--they can both make the depression worse and you're at a greatly increased risk for addiction) are relatively easy (not that anything is actually easy when you're depressed) things that help.\nI'd second the 'if the meds aren't working, try new ones' advice.  If all they've put you on is a cocktail of SSRIs, there are other options (MAOIs are effective, but a pain to deal with in terms of other medications, and are as a result less often proscribed) Also, if your depression has been periodically occurring for a long time and doesn't respond well to traditional medications, it might be worth looking at the symptoms of bipolar disorder to see if they fit.  \nI know several people who were treated for unipolar depression for years before they were diagnosed with bipolar depression:  and the medications and treatments are very different.  Bipolar depression also is rather famous for not responding well to talk therapy.  On the similar note of things that wouldn't respond to medication but are treatable in other ways:  if you haven't been checked for hyper and hypo thyroidism, those can also cause depression-like symptoms that don't respond to traditional medication, and sleep disorders like apnea can make minor depression much worse.","completion":"Very good suggestions here as well!

{"prompt":"Time can be a dimension and still be treated differently.\nIn fact, in special relativity, it is.

(If we sum the squares of space, we must subtract the square of time) (see: minkowski metric, really any metric)\nAnother point of interest would be the matrix representation of the Lorentz transformation (the way to go from one reference frame to another). The matrix \"mixes\" the values of the time coordinate with the space coordinates, and the space coordinates with each other, but time is mixed differently. (This is a nice one to bring up because its clear if you just look at the matrix.)\nThis is very significant for people wondering about time's status as a dimension.

{"prompt":"His post does not cover the whole story, but it is certainly on topic.\nWhere you're from and income level of your parents doesn't just affect your college experience once you're in college, but also earlier in the process.\nI'll provide my anecdote: I grew up in a decent suburb with a decent public school system. However, my high school never produced any Ivy League college students and the counselors and teachers there never presented it as an option. Most kids were only vaguely aware of what the Ivy League even was. It was even a running joke in my year about one student who did apply (\"Oh, so and so thinks he's going to go to \"Harvard\").\nMeanwhile, the neighboring school districts, which were slightly more upper-middle class, routinely produced dozens of Ivy League-bound seniors yearly.\nThe main differences between my district and the neighboring ones was a 10 minute drive and a half century long history of old money in the other neighborhoods.\nThe point is: Where you are from and your surroundings can greatly impact your knowledge and access to higher levels of education.","completion":"Agreed. My life was changed by a single biology teacher who graduated from Harvard in the 1960s. He decided to devote his life to teaching in a sleepy, company-town (East Hartford, CT) public high school rather than pursue research, $$, etc.  On the first day of class in 9th grade, he handed out photocopies of the sheet of paper that alumni interviewers fill out for potential applicants. This sheet of paper had checkboxes indicating achievement levels in things like art, music, sports, research, etc. with the following gradations:\n-locally distinguished\n-distinguished at the town\/county level\n-distinguished at the state level\n-distinguished at the national level\nHe told us that we were not competing with each other, but rather that we were competing with \"a kid from Glastonbury [CT] who drove to school in a BMW this morning\".\nThe message was clear:  if you wanted to get into an ivy, the next four years of school were to be a grand song and dance to get as many state and national level checkmarks as possible.\nWe were lucky to have heard his message. There were a couple thousand other kids in the school that didn't hear it. How could they know that it worked this way?"}
{"prompt":"My father stayed an engineer when most of his peers became managers; many of them became unhappy over time, and quite a few died from heart attacks before reaching 60.\nYeah, I realized that I disliked management (the concept) when I realized that managing is, in most cases, just as bad as being managed.","completion":"And unless you're the CEO, being a manager is both managing and being managed at the same time."}
{"prompt":"While the inclusiveness issue you cite is reasonable enough, the conclusion that \"x applies to normally-excluded group y\" does not signal \"x applies to y in addition to unmentioned but related group z.\"\nIf you mean \"also,\" use \"also.\"  I don't know if you're the author, but regardless, composing based on your perception of the way your audience thinks assumes too much about your audience and their perceptions of the issues you're writing around without being clear.","completion":"In other words, males will feel slighted if you don't explicitly include them in a piece directed towards women? Is it so terrible that males might not be amongst your audience?\nHere is the only gendered sentence in the entire OP:\n> So to all the girls learning how to code, and not sure where you stand: screw it, and just call yourself a developer already.\nIs it really so insulting that she didn't say, \"girls and boys\"? There are only two other gendered words, and they're both pronouns referring to a specific individual."}
{"prompt":"Riak does. You say, when writing, \"please don't return until this data is replicated on 2 servers.\" And when reading, \"please only return a successful read if this data is read from 2 servers.\"\nSo you have R = 2, W = 2, R+W = 4, and if your replication (N) val is 3, you're fine (you're always going to get consistency if R+W > N).\nRiak is cool.","completion":"Riak is cool and what you have described is correct however under failure conditions[1] you may not get this desired behavior.\n[1]http:\/\/docs.basho.com\/riak\/latest\/references\/appendices\/conc..."}

{"prompt":">\"When code breaks often the \"lay\" user notices. The result is obvious to a novice.\"\nThat depends \"how\" it breaks.  As a novice coder myself, I've had things go wrong that I don't notice or can't identify, and it looks like my program is running fine.\nI think that's the parent's point: it might  be stupid to implement crappy macho learning models into production, but it isn't worrisome. It's expected.","completion":"I hear ya.  I knew that assertion was going to draw some criticism as its a judgement call about where we draw the line.  Who's a novice and what's obvious?  However I can't get away from my nagging impression that statistical validity is not inherently clear to the absolute best practitioners.  Causality is the goal, and its notoriously difficult, even for world class minds.  In my experience the only similar effervescent specter for software development is in security.  Such circumstance,seem to me, to require great humility and introspection about ones abilities, but I suppose a little of that would go a long way in general too!"}
{"prompt":"It is not simultaneous. I use the Gillespie technique for stochastic simulation. I select a mouse at random to change boxes, depending on its transition rate compared to the transition rate of the system as a whole.","completion":"Are the mice interchangeable? If so, can you simulate one, get a distribution of box occupancy from it, and compute interactions from that?"}
{"prompt":"I've never considered Tor as a beacon of security, I believe it to be anonymity. If this is secure stuff, you probably want to VPN into a known good host using a hardware token device. Since this is a work thing, they should most likely host the VPN device in their server room with appropriate access to their file servers and intranet.\nI've seen several variants of secure laptops. First one is no boot on the disk at all, just a full disk encryption and a bootable CD.\nThe alternative is generally just full disk encryption.\nIf you have a super secure laptop that your post leads me to believe you want, you don't want to write to USB ever. This is how data leaks if you ever have the laptop stolen. Instead, enable read-only on the USB ports (you can do this in Windows via regedit, haven't had to do a Linux laptop).\nFor traveling with secure devices, simply don't travel with the assembled device. Ship the laptop ahead of you, and only travel with the hard drive, which has the sensitive data. The laptop sans drive is mostly useless, and you're acting as the physical courier for the data. The Dell business laptops that only need 1 or 2 screws removed to take out the hard-drive work well for this.\nAlso use a SSD for FDE, it's just too painful on 5400 rpm.","completion":"How would FDE affect the SSD\/HDD decision (in any way that could favor an SSD)?"}
{"prompt":"Well, no worries then.  A few thousand people who don't get to hospitals or who end up in dangerous situations is not LOOOOOONG term thinking and can safely be ignored.","completion":"Wow, what did people do BEFORE a smartphone!\nIt's a wonder a human being ever found a hospital before Google saved the human race from it's own helplessness!"}
{"prompt":"I have this analogy in mind where the modern-day smartphone is the equivalent of a technological swiss-knife. In 80% of all situations it is sufficient for the task at hand.","completion":"Jesse Schell (http:\/\/g4tv.com\/videos\/44277\/dice-2010-design-outside-the-bo...) said convergence doesn't generally happen, except for the \"pocket exception\", which includes swiss army knives and mobiles. He predicted the failure of the iPad because of this."}
{"prompt":"I found that APL\/Q\/J and vim share the same required mindset. If someone loves one, it is likely he\/she will like another.","completion":"I'm not sure (I'm actually not sure what I think of APL\/Q\/J yet) -- maybe someone that likes vim script would also like APL. Not sure about vi(m) the editor\/modal editors."}
{"prompt":"I don't think it's even functional, as it lacks lambdas. It's just pure insane.","completion":"It's declarative at any rate. It's verbose but as long as it isn't used like an imperative language, I don't find it ugly."}
