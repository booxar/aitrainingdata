{"prompt":"This article is both accurate and highly misleading. The author is correct that there is very little reliable evidence that links glutamic acid and\/or glutamate to health problems. The backlash against MSG as a result of the \"Chinese Restaurant Syndrome\" craze, was not rooted in scientific inquiry.\nHowever, MSG is not just a source for glutamate like seaweed and tomatoes are. MSG is the sodium salt of glutamic acid and contains not just glutamate but also sodium ions. Having 2000mg of natural glutamate should be harmless. Having enough MSG to give you 2000mg of glutamate means you're getting a shit ton of sodium. That's not good for you, especially if you're one of the many people for whom excess sodium intake adversely affects your blood pressure. So while MSG is presumably no worse than NaCl (and is perhaps better in that the umami flavor means you don't have to use as much sodium to get an equally rich taste), to say that MSG is totally harmless without even mentioning sodium and hypertension is ridiculous. Even in terms of short term effects, I've had plenty of MSG-free hot and sour soups that made my head itch. Not from MSG but from thousands of mg of sodium found in their gratuitously added soy sauce and table salt.","completion":"You hit the nail on the head.  For most of us, it's not the MSG that causes the problem.  It's what comes with it.  For starters it's the sodium.

Python 3.4 has generic functions to do single dispatch matching on type.  You can statically type check python now (see pysonar2, pylint, and pycharm for example).  Not only as pypy made a major breakthrough with performant STM based concurrency(no threads), but threading has been improved in python 3 too.

{"prompt":"Very cool, but I sometimes worry that the illusion of safety is more dangerous than the original danger itself.\nIn Boulder, where I live, several crosswalks were identified as being particularly dangerous for pedestrians, and pedestrian crossing signs with big flashing lights were installed at these locations over the past 5 years. This spring, a report was released[1] that showed accidents at many of these crosswalks had actually increased since the lights were installed. \"Taken together, the data suggests that approximately eight additional crossing accidents per year occur at these locations,\" says the report.\nThere are lots of theories about why, but I think it boils down to one thing: when pedestrians can hit a button and light up these big signs which are supposed to make everyone stop, it makes them feel much safer, to the point that many people will hit the button and start walking almost immediately, without taking the time to make sure that all lanes of traffic are aware of their presence and stopping.\nThe prospect of automated cars scares me because, obviously, they cannot be perfect, and they will not be able to identify every dangerous driving scenario. Of course, there is a manual override, but I fear that the car being right 99% of the time will lead to such a complacency in \"drivers\" that, in the 1% of cases where the car is wrong and about to hit something, we will not be able to stop in time. The more accurate the car is, the more safe we feel, and the less likely we are to monitor it as closely and notice when it is wrong.\nAnyway, I rather hope I'm wrong.

That's much safer for both parties.\nThe \"illusion of safety\" is most dangerous at traffic lights. 2-3 times I've had cars just sail through, completely oblivious. Note: they're sailing through on RED lights. Not amber going red. It's not one of those borderline cases.\nOnce I had a cop have a chat to me about jaywalking but I've never been fined. I would be pissed if I ever was. In a fight between a car and a pedestrian the pedestrian loses (big time) so pedestrians have a higher vested interest in their own safety. I know what the light changes are at intersections I cross a lot. Where are these cops when cars sail through red lights or nearly run over pedestrians when turning when the pedestrians have right of way?\nI get the distinct impression these skills will come in handy when I move to New York next month!\nAnyway, back to the self-driving cars: this I believe will be a painful transition that will take many, many years.

Now, as a \"born\" software engineer with a decent portfolio (now age 21) recently frustratated by a fruitless job search, turned down again and again (I believe rightfully so) because the competition all had college degrees, I beg to differ.\nA good college degree (especially in STEM fields) provide the basic foundation upon which to innovate. Our industries have gone so deep, and we are standing on such giant shoulders, that anyone who is going to take it further must first absorb the century or so of knowledge created so far on the subject.

{"prompt":"Over the last decade, the distributed system nature of modern server hardware internals has become painfully evident in how software architectures scale on a single machine. The traditional approaches -- multithreading, locking, lock-free structures, etc -- are all forms of coordination and agreement in a distributed system, with the attendant scalability problems if not used very carefully.\nAt some point several years ago, a few people noticed that if you attack the problem of scalable distribution within a single server the same way you would in large distributed systems (e.g. shared nothing architectures) that you could realize huge performance increases on a single machine. The caveat is that the software architectures look unorthodox.\nThe general model looks like this:\n- one process per core, each locked to a single core\n- use locked local RAM only (effectively limiting NUMA)\n- direct dedicated network queue (bypass kernel)\n- direct storage I\/O (bypass kernel)\nIf you do it right, you minimize the amount of silicon that is shared between processes which has surprisingly large performance benefits. Linux has facilities that make this relatively straightforward too.\nAs a consequence, adjacent cores on the same CPU have only marginally more interaction with each other than cores on different machines entirely. Treating a single server as a distributed cluster of 1-core machines, and writing the software in such a way that the operating system behavior reflects that model to the extent possible, is a great architecture for extreme performance but you rarely see it outside of closed source software.\nAs a corollary, garbage-collected languages do not work for this at all.","completion":"> one process per core, each locked to a single core; use locked local RAM only (effectively limiting NUMA); direct dedicated network queue (bypass kernel); direct storage I\/O (bypass kernel)\nI have no idea how to do any of these things.

{"prompt":"Copied from the other thread, because it bears repeating:\nI think it's important to keep in mind that the 12 vote margin is comfortable for Amash and supporters of new NSA restrictions and uncomfortable for its defenders.\nHere's why: opponents of Amash wielded an argument that \"split the vote\". Representatives who voted against Amash could have done so for one of two reasons:\n(1) They actively support providing the NSA with unchecked access to cell phone metadata under the \"business records\" provision of PATRIOT, or\n(2) They don't support that access, but can't support a broad amendment that potentially de-funds whole NSA programs, and instead need something finer grained to correct NSA with.\nMeanwhile, everyone who supported Amash believes strongly --- so strongly that they're willing to do something disruptive to NSA --- that new checks on NSA are needed.\n(I think Amash was a good amendment, if only because it  would force the House to do its actual job and carefully regulate intelligence collection; if it caused a temporary shitstorm, so much the better --- it'd be a well-deserved comeuppance for a legislature that has been derelict in its duty to oversee these programs.

{"prompt":"> Tesla are a sideshow and we desperately need to stop talking about them, because they're harming efforts to improve energy efficiency.\nCompletely disagree.  Tesla is, I think, unquestionably the most impactful company in the game, including GE and Nissan.  For two reasons.\nFirst, before Tesla people thought of electric vehicles as ridiculous DIY golf carts driven by treehuggers.  They were utterly uncool and stupid.  Post-Tesla, electric cars are among the very coolest cars in the world.  GE didn't do that.  Nissan didn't do that.  Toyota didn't do that.  Tesla did.  I think fundamentally changing people's perceptions of what an electric car is and what it can do is the single most impactful action in the industry so far.\nSecond, Tesla's critical product isn't their cars.  Their critical product is their battery technology.  It is second to none, in a business where the battery is everything.  This is the reason that both Daimler and Toyota have invested in the company.  I think you are seriously underestimating how important this is.\nAs to the article proper: it seems to me that running down your car is a pretty simple problem to engineer away.  This might be an issue, perhaps a burp that Tesla has to get fixed pronto.  But it's hardly, to use the breathless headline, devastating.","completion":"Their critical product is their battery technology.

{"prompt":"If Bitcoin ever graduates to anything more than a toy currency (last count was a billion or two USD globally?) then it's going to have to deal with graduate level problems.  The business cycle is a thing I'm afraid, and the management of a recession to prevent it's becoming a depression is as close to a fusion of science and art as you'll ever see.  The necessity for this isn't going to change as long as the human brain continues to function as it does.\nIn good times people want more money - a discussion on what they should want is irrelevant, lets stick to the facts - and in bad times people want to protect what they have (aggressively so).  Now consider that what makes times good vs bad is not determined by money - it's determined and prolonged by some other shock like an asset misvaluation, the destruction of a massive crop, or some combination of external factors underlying the real or nominal non-money thing.\nLet's say it's a rice crop.  Those dependent on rice freak out, and push all their money into safe assets, those dependent on those dependent on rice do the same.  The chain reaction continues until all the economy's money is tied up in safe assets, not being spent, and everyone is sat at home waiting for it to blow over.  If policymakers do not intervene correctly at this point, this situation will become a depression, and much misery will ensue.\nSo what do we do?  We make safe assets more expensive to lower the risk\/reward ratio for commercial activities: we make bank holdings very unrewarding (lower interest rates), we devalue the money in circulation and provide liquidity in one move (print money), and government invests in big infrastructure (liquidity, jobs, momentum, signalling etc).  All of this is designed to keep things moving and ward off a depression.  And it works - this is why we abandoned the gold standard.\nSo given that Bitcoin means nothing to rice, or most other external factors, and not to the rigidities that exacerbate recessions - how exactly do we deal with this in the described autonomous utopia?\nI very much agree that the regulators of currency leave a tremendous amount to be desired, but unfortunately this appears to be one of very few economic problems where decentralisation is not the answer.","completion":"Consider that with bitcoin the \"safest\" asset is also the most liquid (easiest to exchange)."}

You especially wouldn't let the janitor have an equal say - he's got no experience in desiging such things!\nI'm always very uneasy about equality talks because all people are not equally suited to make global policy decisions. Nor are they equally incentivized to make the most informed and rational decisions.\nI'm not saying that there isn't a problem or that we shouldn't do anything about it, but I am saying that I disagree with an egalitarian approach. We want the majority of decisions to be made by people who understand what they are deciding and have lots of experience, not to be made by individuals who mostly understand the topic from a single reddit thread.

Evil beats XVim hands down, but XVim is a lot better than the others I tried: IdeaVim (for Intellij), Vrapper (Vim for Eclipse), and Vintage (Vim for Sublime).

{"prompt":"Apple's \"Think Different \/ Change the World\" ad was a brilliant piece of marketing.  But it doesn't seem that really stuck as the core value of their brand.  If Nike's message is \"we hang around great athletes,\" Apple's message today is \"we hang around the young and hip,\" [1] which is different than \"we hang around people who change the world.\"\nYou could argue that these are somehow related, that the young and hip would be attracted by the Think Different ad.  I don't dispute that.  But the later ads of kids jamming with their iPod ear buds communicate a message that is much closer to the general perception of Apple as a brand today.\n--\n[1] In the clothing industry, this type of positioning wouldn't be noteworthy or distinguishing.  But in consumer electronics, advertising more like Abercrombie & Fitch and less like IBM has worked out brilliantly for them.\n[2] The pre-2000 perception of Apple's brand was also somewhat tangential to the idea of changing the world.  Their core message was \"we're not IBM.\"  In the talk, Jobs mentions this shouldn't be their core message, but clearly it was.  The 1984 ad reinforced this, and even the 1997 Think Different ad retrenched this ground by riffing off of IBM's motto.\n[3] Edit: The idea that Apple's core customer is someone who \"values their time\" and is not a computer geek is meaninglessly broad.  Every customer values his or her time, and in any mainstream industry, the vast majority of customers are not computer geeks.\n[4] Edit: Was it the success of the iPod that made Apple hip, or was the perception of the iPod being hip part of what made it such a success?  Clearly it did become a fashion accessory.  The product's clean design was congruent with this message.","completion":"we hang around the young and hip\nIs that not the same as Evian's slogan - live young, or pepsi's marketing way back to the younger people.

{"prompt":"Co-founder of Stack Overflow, here.\nA lot of the people who were involved in some way in Experts-Exchange don't understand Stack Overflow.\nThe basic value flow of EE is that \"experts\" provide valuable \"answers\" for novices with questions. In that equation there's one person asking a question and one person writing an answer.\nStack Overflow recognizes that for every person who asks a question, 100 - 10,000 people will type that same question into Google and find an answer that has already been written. In our equation, we are a community of people writing answers that will be read by hundreds or thousands of people. Ours is a project more like wikipedia -- collaboratively creating a resource for the Internet  at large.\nBecause that resource is provided by the community, it belongs to the community. That's why our data is freely available and licensed under creative commons. We did this specifically because of the negative experience we had with EE taking a community-generated resource and deciding to slap a paywall around it.\nThe attitude of many EE contributors, like Greg Young who calculates that he \"worked\" for half a year for free, is not shared by the 60,000 people who write answers on SO every month. When you talk to them you realize that on Stack Overflow, answering questions is about learning. It's about creating a permanent artifact to make the Internet better. It's about helping someone solve a problem in five minutes that would have taken them hours to solve on their own. It's not about working for free.\nAs soon as EE introduced the concept of money they forced everybody to think of their work on EE as just that -- work.","completion":"I come across at least two people every week wanting to learn how to program, instead of giving them a 500-page C book I tell them to go to SO and try to help someone, research on google a random subject\/question etc, then they start the reverse approach towards tools such as \"I think I know how to do this, but how can I run python on my computer?\" instead of installing 80GB of IDEs without knowing what they are for.\nThe results are amazing, they decide their favorite subjects without personal bias (a female friend got ultra hooked on SQL for example, even tho I hate it as a business language) and you just watch them fly.\nI also make sure to point out that the reputation is not a certification of authority or correctness, as I see they are just experience points, just how much you learned while being nice enough to share that experience.\nI am not a fan of the SE network splitting the subjects but understand why it exists right now, but I also think it is just an amazing problem to spend years on."}

{"prompt":"There is a very important question here: What is the relationship between you and the bank?\nUp until recently, it has been considered sacrosanct that deposit holders be protected, no matter the cost.  The convention and social contract has been that you deposit money for safe-keeping in a bank.  We have seen this over the past few years across both Europe and the US, as insolvent banks have been bailed-out, nationalised, given secret loans, so that deposit holders are wholly protected.\nWith Cyprus, this widely held belief is now in tatters.  You as a deposit holder are now a creditor of the bank.  As soon as you lend your money to the bank, it is no longer yours.  The bank will provide you with interest for the duration of the loan.  If the bank is no longer a going concern, you will no longer receive special treatment, but instead you must get in line with other creditors.\nSome may argue that this has always been the case[1], however it will be a genuine shock to many people, and any faith in deposit guarantee schemes has been dealt a severe blow when a week ago, the EU urged Cyprus to collectively punish all deposit holders regardless of balance.\n[1] For those in the UK, the House of Lords said in Foley v Hill 1848 http:\/\/www.uniset.ca\/other\/css\/9ER1002.html\n\"Money, when paid into a bank, ceases altogether to be the money of the principal... The money placed in custody of a banker is, to all intents and purposes, the money of the banker, to do with it as he pleases... he is, of course, answerable for the amount, because he has contracted, having received that money, to repay to the principal, when demanded, a sum equivalent to that paid into his hands... the banker is not an agent or factor, but he is a debtor.\"","completion":"\"... the EU urged Cyprus to collectively punish all deposit holders regardless of balance.\"\nIs this true?

I have never got to the end of one.\nIf you need that much animation on a page to tell your story, isn't it a good sign that video might be more fit for purpose? Video was designed for storytelling, it will work on most devices, and it has well-established UI and conventions, such as a play button and progress bar.\nIf you're going to provide a play button in your scrollmation to automatically advance the action anyway, you've already recognised how irritating it is to manually page through an animated story by scrolling or swiping. So why then go to the trouble of creating a scroll-based animation that repurposes a 20+ year old convention and attempts to reinvent a tiny proportion of what video has to offer?\nIs it just for the novelty value?\nIs it because it makes you feel smarter?\nHow is it better for users trying to understand your story?\nI'd love to hear from anyone who's considered both video and scrollmation and chosen the latter.","completion":"> What motivates web designers to tell stories by repurposing the scroll mechanism instead of, say, using video?\nControl for the users."}

{"prompt":"Hi all. A few clarifications.\n- The meme that we are adding more and more features into the docker binary is unfounded. Please, please, I ask that before repeating it you do your homework and ask for actual examples. For example 1.4 is coming out next week: it has 500+ commits and basically no new features. It's all bugfixes, refactoring and a general focus on quality. That's going to be the trend from now on\n- Swarm and Machine are separate binaries. They are not part of the core docker runtime. You can use them in a completely orthogonal way.\n- Swarm follows the \"batteries included but removable\" principle. We are not doing all things to all people! There is a default scheduling backend but we want to make it swappable. In fact we had Mesosphere on stage today as part of a partnership to make Mesos a first-class backend.\n- there is an ongoing proposal to merge compose into the docker binary.

We may find that strange but if it helps with the adoption of Docker, then it benefits every Docker user and that's ok with me. On the other hand, it is definitely not popular on HN and has the opposite connotation of dorky pencil holder suit douchiness. Being from that tribe I share that instinctive reaction. But I also realize it's mostly psychological. I care less about the specific choice of words than the substance. And the substance here is that we launched a lot of new stuff today, and put a lot of effort in keeping the focus on a small, reliable runtime, composable tools which do one thing well, pluggability, open APIs, and playing nice with the ecosystem.

Just because you think there's something wrong with it, doesn't mean there is something wrong with it. I ran my own consumer electronics retail business for 5 years and about 70% of returns have absolutely nothing wrong with them. NewEgg can't just throw the stuff away, they'd go out of business.\nThey also can't just send the stuff to the manufacturer. The manufacturer doesn't care about your issues and if you return stock of which 70% is functional for warranty service, they will kick your ass.\nSo you hire guys to test the equipment and return it to sell-able condition and sell it as an open-box return.\nBack to our little problem. You bought a laptop. Great! You install Linux on it. Fine! Is it really that much trouble to return it to the same condition when you send it back?\nNewEgg has to hire guys who sit there for hours installing Windows from the non-existent install disks (they don't include those anymore ... you gotta download them) so that they can recoup their losses? It would cost them more than the laptop is worth.\nIf the laptop is truly defective, and you can't install the original operating system as a consequence, NewEgg has no quick means of determining what you did with the system ... and the manufacturer won't care either.\nSo if you buy a laptop and decide to return it, return it to factory condition.

Thinking that somehow this is what 'coding' is, is missing the point.\nI will read a stack overflow page perhaps in a search for some direction, look at all the 'solutions' like surveying a landscape of others approaches to the problem. Then I'll throw them all away and code my own. Possibly it will share a lot with one of the answers, what I would consider a good approach. But a literal copy and paste just doesn't happen. I would consider a copy and paste a recipe for inviting trouble, because you haven't really reasoned through the problem yourself, and thus don't really understand the solution intimately.\nProgramming is a process of mental reasoning around your problem with an eye on the form of reasoning computers use, so you can express that reasoning to the computer in the language you're using. Because computers don't reason like humans 'reason' (ie. humans don't really 'reason'...), knowing how a computer reasons and behaves is alien and takes time to understand and learn and it takes time to become quicker at comprehending this. This is the path of becoming a better programmer. Gaining that experience so the process is less alien and you more easily can fathom how a computer will respond and behave with a certain approach of laying out of the logic you are trying to express.\nCopy and paste doesn't help you at all with this.

{"prompt":"The problem with this article is that a lot of things that are cheap for one serving go stale before you eat the second.\nFor instance, on day one, he adds some mint which cost ~50p to buy, but he calls 1p because he only eats a little. He does not eat the rest of the mint that week, so it cost him ~50p, i.e. half the days budget.\nI am poor and eat very cheap. I do that using dry bulk foods and frozen veg. This is important because there are opportunities for free meals (e.g. if customers at work do not eat all the sand witches and biscuits, that can be lunch for 2 days). Friends invite you for dinner too. If you buy food that spoils, opportunities like this come at a price.\nHow about this for a suggestion - mix lentils, buck wheat, brown rice, dried beans, quinoa. These come in 500g bags for about a pound. You need 6 spoons of this mix per meal, so 10 pounds of mix will last you several months. Put in a rice cooker for 40 min (some beans need soaking first), with a chicken stock cube. Cook for 20 mins then add mixed frozen veg. This will cost you about 30p per meal, and is pretty much complete [1].\nI eat the above most of the time, and take free food whenever possible.

I know fifteen years ago I was making video calls over my GSM phone, chatting with people via SMS, AIM, and ICQ, etc.   Literally nothing in this post is in any way amazing to anyone who actually remembers life ten years ago.  We had smartphones.  We had social media.  We had web forums.  Just because you've dumped money into some of them doesn't make them special or even interesting from a technology standpoint.\nI, too, support SpaceX (as well as Orbital Sciences, Virgin Galactic, etc) but pretending that reddit is even anywhere near that list as far as being \"unimaginably fantastic\" is either depressingly credulous or else clumsy false optimism.\nSpecifically in computing, the past ten or fifteen years have been a war on general-purpose computing; all the brands names he's slinging around amount to a celebration of the black-boxing of internet services.  Ten years ago I could do all this stuff without needing a quad-core 2GHz phone to run a full-featured HTML5\/CSS\/JS browser platform.\nMore generally, in cars, computers, and most other sectors in technology, things are getting less and less accessible to casual interest or even moderately-dedicated hobbyists.  Sometimes it's in the name of efficiency, sometimes it's in the name of corporate control, but with the exception of the Tesla, everything he talks about existed ten years ago in some form.

{"prompt":"I worked at an Apple store for over a year as a \"salesperson\" (we called them Mac Specialists at the time). Let me input my two cents:\nI was trained to do this. From day one of dedicated 8-hour training sessions, we're trained to find customers the right \"solution\" rather than get the most money. This requires using the APPLE technique (acronym, google it). The second P stands for \"Present a solution for the customer to take home today.\" It was common knowledge at the time (4 years ago) that consumers were brainwashed to thinking faster\/more is always better. But when we can save them hundreds of dollars, this isn't the case. There were many many times I talked someone out of a $2,000 MacBook Pro for a $1200 entry-level iMac with double the specs because after probing (the first \"P\") I learned they didn't need to be mobile. This was really, really common.\nAnd note, this isn't about trying to convince people to spend less. Sometimes after probing, we learned they needed _more_. It is about the RIGHT solution.\nTo add to this: specialists don't earn commission. We weren't ranked based on financial sales numbers (there are other metrics, however). There is no incentive for specialists to sell more expensive or less expensive things. It is about the right thing.\nSo, this guy was just doing what he was trained to do. It is Apple store standard.","completion":"I agree that Apple, as the case is at every brick-and-mortar store that I'm loyal to (B&H Photo has often talked me out of expensive purchases), has a great incentive to not oversell an unneeded product.\nHowever, I think we need more data on recommendations before we can argue that the intent is entirely altruistic. As others have said, the low-end model is also the same model as the \"Vanilla\" build, i.e. the model that Apple has plenty of in stock...and a purchase in-store (with the possibility of upselling on other accessories) is more valuable than a purchase from the web. If it's the case that Apple sells a disproportionate amount of its Vanilla stock in-store, then is it coincidence that the Vanilla stock happens to be the perfect fit for so many customers? How many slightly-upgraded (but not in-stock) models are customers convinced to buy...because there has to be at least a few customers for whom the MBP is not ideal, but a slightly upgraded MBA is needed.\nAnd if you want to be totally cynical, you could argue that Apple is ensuring that the customer returns in the nearer future by selling them a less future-proof model. Yes, customers have loyalty based on the reliability of the brand...but if the compassionate-sales-job is so effective, then that alone may be good enough of a memory for the customer to overlook that he\/she is replacing a new laptop a year earlier than expected."}

Actually I think that many people like the idea of their posts are being read by as many people as possible and not just the ones with similar interests. Although it looks like a big discussion group, the news feed is really a giant personality-defining display for vain people.

I have the feeling that most really don't care very much. But ironically, I think the privacy-thing could actually work in facebook's favor. Here is why: I use fb a lot even though I don't like their privacy policies. I trust google more than facebook. Still, it bothers me when it says \"logged in\" in the google bar at the top because google watches my searches. When I am on facebook I behave like I am in public. I don't hope for the best and write secret stuff anywhere.

And god forbid you talk about your emotions...that's a female thing.\nBut the thing is, those activities are what allow us to be vulnerable and what allow us to bond with others. The more you suppress those urges, the more you end up feeling alone.

{"prompt":"Oh for heavens' sakes. Yet more ignorance.\nA more realistic view of C:\n- C is straightforward to compile into fast machine code...on a PDP-11. Its virtual machine does not match modern architectures very well, and its explicitness about details of its machine mean FORTRAN compilers typically produce faster code. The C virtual machine does not provide an accurate model of why your code is fast on a modern machine. The social necessity of implementing a decent C compiler may have stifled our architecture development (go look at the Burroughs systems, or the Connection Machine, and tell me how well C's virtual machine maps to them).\n- C's standard library is a joke. Its shortcomings, particularly around string handling, have been responsible for an appalling fraction of the security holes of the past forty years.\n- C's tooling is hardly something to brag about, especially compared to its contemporaries like Smalltalk and Lisp. Most of the debuggers people use with C are command line monstrosities. Compare them to the standard debuggers of, say, Squeak or Allegro Common Lisp.\n- Claiming a fast build\/debug\/run cycle for C is sad. It seems fast because of the failure in this area of C++. Go look at Turbo Pascal if you want to know how to make the build\/debug\/run cycle fast.\n- Claiming that C is callable from anywhere via its standard ABI equates all the world with Unix. Sadly, that's almost true today, though, but maybe it's because of the ubiquity of C rather than the other way around.\nSo, before writing about the glories of C, please go familiarize yourself with modern FORTRAN, ALGOL 60 and 68, Turbo Pascal's compiler and environment, a good Smalltalk like Squeak or Pharo, and the state of modern pipelines processor architectures.","completion":"> The social necessity of implementing a decent C compiler may have stifled our architecture development\nthe idea that specific requirements of c had started driving architecture development blew my mind the first time i came across it. it is still a point that does not get discussed nearly enough at a popular level."}

Unfortunately, the philosophy course seemed deeply rooted in classical theories like dualism (which I think of as a rationalization for religious dogma), ignoring any and all modern advances in neuroscience. The final straw was the lecture unit on \"artificial minds\". There was a lot of uninformed speculation about AI, which really disappointed me.

The places that were bartering were doing so because it was some low hanging fruit way to increase business and it was easy to to. And they were places that weren't particularly popular on their own (restaurants let's say) so they would do bartering to bring in customers on Monday nights but not allow it for obvious reasons on Saturday or Friday night.  There is always a feeling on the part of small business owners that barter dollars are not real dollars (even though there is value in many cases) and barter business is not real business.  A place that isn't doing that well to begin with (and once again I realize this is a generalization that is not true in many cases) is not going to have the best employees or the best attitudes because they are running short on cash and can't pay the best wages or have the best working conditions. So it's an entire ecosystem of mediocrity that you (in your case or me in my case) might end up experiencing.\nSo I guess in theory someone taking groupon (or barter dollars) should just be a regular business that is doing well wanting to increase business. But in actual cases it might more often (from my experience at least) be a marginal business that is trying to fix a situation with marketing that isn't exactly going to work as planned by bringing in groupon dollars or barter dollars (that will end up being used by the owner to go out to dinner with his wife (and yes that is what happened)). Valuable things (in the case of barter dollars) that a business needs are not typically available with barter dollars. What you get is a bunch of things like dining, travel or accountants or attorneys (and how many of those do you need)."}

However, We're looking at 90% fatality rates to get to that point due to lack of food production. Probably would be even less than that. No chance in happening, unless forced by catastrophic event.\nAnother possibility is tremendous rationing. We see what having even simple healthcare is in this country. Instead, we would look at rationing everything in the world, including determining who lives and dies by how much resources they use (carbon debt). With 2 high input\/output countries, good luck on this happening either.\nAnd we have to look at all the smaller ways to handle global warming. One proposal is to dump megatonnes of lime in the ocean?! Or perhaps this carbon credits scam: it makes the rich richer (Well, where DOES the money go?). At least sources of energy like solar or wind make sense... Until you realise the amount of energy to make a solar panel is greater than the total energy you will get out of it. Bummer.\nAnd underlying is this assumption that global warming == CO2 peak.. I've heard of this law called thermodynamics. CO2 may trap heat, but heat generated anywhere is still heat. We generate heat via our vehicles, electric grid, generators, burn piles, and other human sources of heat. Is this not a direct consideration as well?"}

To me it is a question of whether or not someone was a dedicated member to the group or simply someone who was hired to do a set job. I mean, some musicians do all the songwriting and playing, some are hired to play a given sheet music verbatim, etc. The latter is not very different from a sound engineer who is hired to work on one album for a fixed hourly pay.\nIt's kind of interesting how the musicians are the heroes of the music world and always the one that are focused on when it comes to \"fair pay\" etc, but the world of music isn't simply divided into the working musicians and the record label suits. Some people have suggested donating to the musicians directly instead of buying their albums (opting to pirate them instead), and that works of course the band was behind financing the whole album.

It's all the damn parens and (optional) semicolons and braces and no-win indenting scenarios that frustrate people who try to exploit JavaScript to its fullest.\nYes, CoffeeScript solves these problems and others, but through the introduction, as I said before, of yet a new set of rules that result in whitespace-sensitive line noise code that requires frequent contact to stay familiar with. And again, I'm a busy person: a new language wastes my time because I already need to write shell scripts, Clojure, and Python in a daily basis. I know JavaScript, even if I dislike it.\nAnd if you're going to learn a language that doesn't help your resume with The Man, you may as well learn a language that can change your life. Like a lisp.","completion":"I think lisps are too crufty. I prefer whitespace to parentheses."}
{"prompt":"Fog Creek and 37Signals are probably more alike than either of us would care to admit (ha!) and I could see Joel writing a very similar article a few years ago when we had 20some people at the company.  But what works there, or at FC, is not a one size fits all answer.\nHaving managers when there are 10 people are at your company makes no sense.  The hierarchy starts out flat, you add a few more people and you're at 20, and the idea of making someone a manager seems like a waste and something a 'BigCo' would do.  \"We need people who get stuff done, not people who sit around doing nothing but managing\", you think.  Then you get to 50 people and everything breaks down.  You wonder why people are frustrated they can't get things done, while other people are doing things that embarrass your company or compete with other things you are doing.  And you realize your company isn't a special little gem that is wholly unlike every other company in existence.  You need management.\nJust make sure you give the devs a professional ladder and compensation structure that doesn't involve moving to management, because managing isn't something everyone is good at or even wants to do.  And make sure that management knows their job is a support role to the people at the company who are making things happen, not the other way around.","completion":"The article mentioned rotating managerial duties, and alternative methods of adding structure.

You know something is going wrong when you start promoting your unit test or A\/B testing tools.\nWatch out for IT. IT for people without a degree is a trap.\nConsider staying in school long enough to pick up math. Math didn't matter much in my first 10 years or so, but it matters a lot to me now, and doing it on my own is a slog.

This made NoSQL seem like a breath of fresh air.\n(2) Startups! Ship now! MVP! Fail fast! The whole industry has been operating on this ship-fast-fail-fast way of doing things that prioritizes development speed and agility over correctness. That's because half the time what you are developing will be thrown away anyway -- it will fail, or you'll \"pivot\" and rip it all apart and almost start over. No point in static languages, SQL schemas, or other explicit design elements in that world.\n#2 is I think the more significant of the two for things like schema-less MongoDB or dynamic languages.

{"prompt":"From a student's point of view: I hated professors who made their own webpage just about as much as I hated Blackboard. A big downside to Blackboard was that every professor had their own way of using the tool, but it was worse with professors who made their own sites.

I'd have to learn how to use the site again every time I took a new class.

I'm not so sure that \"everyone dress up as a Klan member day\" would be so unreasonable, if some other group of crazies showed up and started killing people, crazies so crazy that they made the Klan seem sympathetic by comparison.  It's hard to envision anyone that much crazier than the Klan, but that's because it's a bad analogy.\nI wouldn't normally be in favor of racist cartoons, but if it's between racist cartoonists and nutbags who would actually kill someone over a cartoon, I'm with the cartoonists.  Making race jokes is dumb but murdering people is orders of magnitude worse.\n\"Engag[ing] in speech you despise in order to back the principle that it should be protected\" seems like a fairly decent strategy to me, insofar as it demonstrates the fruitlessness of trying to achieve censorship through terror and drives the murderers into more and more indefensible, outrageous positions.

{"prompt":"This is thought-provoking, which is good.  However there are significant issues with the approach.\n1. Real world performance varies over time.  For instance there are typically daily, weekly and monthly conversion rate fluctuations.  Not an issue for A\/B testing, but a big issue for this approach if a random switch in direction happens at the same time that conversion fluctuations happen to head in a good direction.\n2. (This is really a special case of #1 - but a very, very important special case.)  This approach creates long-lasting interaction effects between tests and independent changes.  That requires explanation.  Suppose you're running a test.  Version A is somewhat better.  But version B is temporarily looking slightly better when you make a significant improvement to your website (maybe you started another test that works).  Now you're adding a lot of good traffic to version B (good because of the other change) and very little of the new good traffic to version A.  This new version B traffic soundly beats your old version A traffic.  This correlation between time and website performance will continue until the old version A traffic is completely swamped by new version A traffic.  With only 5% of your traffic going to version A, this can easily take 100x as long as your test has been running - or more.  (Properly constructed A\/B tests do not suffer this statistical anomaly.)\n3. Code over time gets messy.  One of the most important characteristics of A\/B testing is that you can delete the mess and move on.  With this approach you can't - it just hangs around adding to your technical debt.\n4. Businesses are complex, and often have multiple measures they would like to balance.  For instance in a recent test, conversion to click was hurt, conversion to a person who clicked 5x was helped.  A\/B testing let us notice that something weird was going on and think about what we really cared about.  This automated approach would make a decision and could have hidden a real problem.\n5. Many tests perform differently on existing users and new users.  A\/B testing with proper cohort analysis can let you tease this out and decide accordingly.  This approach doesn't give you that kind of sophistication.","completion":"re: #3... you can also remove items at will.

I always, always ask for something in return if I am giving up something and do my best to make sure what I get in return is more valuable than the money discount they are asking for. Often time I use this as a segue with a customer to discuss retainer billing models. Most people balk at it but if it is part of a give and take over the rate they will embrace it. Give me the choice of a project with pre-paid hours at 150\/hr vs NET 30 at 165 and I am choosing the 150 all day long.\nAnother point, if you relax your rate - sunset the change. 'I am willing to do this project at $150\/hr but only for this project - future work we do together will revert to the $165\/hr rate'. Put it in writing.","completion":"Find out why they are asking this question, find out what they really want - 8 out of 10 times for me, it is just them asking because it would be dumb not to ask. Explain your rates, be open and honest about them. If they feel like your rates are too high for them then be willing to negotiate.\nYes! And just like anything else, be prepared for these kinds of questions and have a suggestion that can be accepted by both parties and count as a win. Like having your rates 10% inflated up front, but then giving 10% discount for paying early etc. They want to pay less, and you want to rely on the money coming. Also you can assuage their fears from the other side by proposing intermediate milestones."}

{"prompt":"Hmmm... Well... there are ways:\na) disable flash\nb) disable java\nc) disable any plugins really.\nd) use chrome (at least)\ne) do not allow downloading of any file. Instead use chrome's plugin to open any word\/etc files in google docs.\nf) Use a chromebook. Chromebooks can't really execute programs like windows machines can, so it's fairly safe. And worst case is you expose a sandbox machine with no private data other than caches, that can be set to be cleared on sleep or whatever. Bonus security points:\n- if a chromebook is hijacked, it will only be hijacked until a reboot during which time the chromebook does a sanity check ensuring the OS is exactly intact. If it is not it just reinstalls the OS from ROM. Basically no long-term compromised machines.\n- The only time chrome's sandbox was ever completely bypassed allowing arbitrary code execution was using a combination of multiple chrome exploits (now closed) and a windows data execution prevention bug. That can't happen on linux (and the chrome team works to further solidify that sandbox). Pretty much almost impossible.

By doing so, the HSI-UC was able to interact directly with BENTHALL throughout his operation of the website.\"\nSo I assume this means they were able to infiltrate the community and there was possibly no unauthorized break necessary on the actual technology stack. It does lead one to question how they drew the final line between Benthall and his online persona, unless the undercover agent was also given access to financial information or other personally identifiable info. Maybe they even placed a malicious program on the server to target Benthall after they had control of a support backend.

I have witnessed friends going the random shuffle route lately...\nCreating a huge amount of playlists seems like (too) hard work.\nEdit: OK, if music is free as in no purchase necessary, a whole new host of applications comes to mind.

The first that pops to mind is space.com - which kept showing a footer ad even though I clicked the \"X\" - but that's only my immediate example because I'd been to that site more yesterday due to the Mars launch than I have in quite some time.\nI noticed that a lot of newpapers seem to have ads that make me want to turn and run away.  The full page ads with the \"Click to continue\" link at the top right.  Forbes.com comes to mind immediately.  Those ads are repulsive and make me never want to return.  And while on the subject, any site that shows a 10 - 15 second video ad before a 15 second video clip will no longer get any of my attention, links, clicks, etc.\nIf I'm going to continue to try to use the web with ads enabled, I have to draw a line as to what is and isn't acceptable.  I haven't tried bitboxer's fork yet, but it sounds like a step in the right direction.

{"prompt":"This is a well-intentioned but terrible idea.\nThis idea fails even on its own, since it presumes that URLs have structure, even within a particular site. So if you want to add a new page, even a one-off for a special occasion, then you have to start thinking about where it fits in your ad hoc URL\/navigation scheme, too. Also, if you want to redesign navigation, you have to change all your URLs. URLs are brilliant because they are separate from navigation; that's a feature, not a bug.\nBut it's also philosophically wrong. The URL -- a simple string that can be used to fetch any resource -- is the single greatest innovation of the web. A simple string can pass through literally any human communication system. Speech, print, text messaging, anything. A URL is not an inherently intuitive concept so it is not all that usable. But it's necessary.

The breakdown in cost is:\n   Surgeon charge:   7,043\n   Facility charge: 10,200\n   Anesthesiology:   1,000\n\nNow, the surgeon is very good at what he does and I feel he certainly deserves that $7000.  His surgical schedule has him doing procedures twice a week, probably some more complicated than mine, and I'm sure he easily brings in several million dollars to his practice, some non-trivial amount of which comes from Medicare.

And as the GP notes, Facebook solves the problem that teens haven't yet had to confront - how do you catch up with your friends when you don't seem them several times a week?\nIn fact, the thing that has made Facebook such a phenomenon is not that teens found it cool, but rather that the much larger older population found it useful. I would be willing to bet that teens don't even make up 10% of Facebook at this point in time.  When adults stop posting and stop receiving notifications on Facebook, then Facebook has something to worry about.  Until then, my money would be on teens gravitating back to Facebook as they get older, and being cool becomes less important than knowing that all of your friends are contactable on Facebook.","completion":"Facebook solves the problem that teens haven't yet had to confront - how do you catch up with your friends when you don't seem them several times a week?\nTwitter.  Every teen I know, though admittedly a small sample, says that facebook is for old people and twitter is the way they communicate with each other. Constantly.\nUntil then, my money would be on teens gravitating back to Facebook as they get older...knowing that all of your friends are contactable on Facebook.  No they won't be.  The ones in their social circle will be on twitter or something like that that replaces it.  Facebook will gray out; even the older people I know that haven't deleted their profile yet are getting tired of it."}
{"prompt":"FWIW, I had my real email addresses showing before this weekend and when I checked this morning, the only email address that was being shown was the @facebook.com one. My other 2 email addresses (one visible to each of my friends and one only to a close few) were hidden from my timeline. Shady!!","completion":"I can confirm. I also had 2 public email addresses that were hidden.\nI also remember that I always disallowed Facebook from using a \"fake\" address in case some app wanted my email address."}
{"prompt":"Please, don't take this very seriously, the guy oversimplifies and misrepresents ADHD symptoms, our environment, and treatments.\nA few specific quibbles:\nThe article says it's not a \"disorder\", but a \"disorder\" in psychiatry-speak means \"Any pattern of psychological or behavioral symptoms that causes an individual significant distress, impairs their ability to function in life, and\/or significantly increases their risk of death, pain, disability, or loss of freedom.\" ADHD symptoms may not represent a disorder for every individual in every situation. It's fine to say \"change the environment\" but that's not always an option.\nNot to mention the \"hunter-gatherer vs farmer\" dichotomy doesn't explain the rise of ADHD diagnoses in the last 20 years mostly in the US vs other western countries, which are just as rich and just as regimented.\nThe other issue I have is with Thom Hartmann's description of ADHD which focuses on distractability and hyperactivity, but those are just two of the most common of the many symptoms that make up ADHD.\nFinally, the woman apparently is familiar with abusing Adderall herself. Speaking as someone who has ADHD and benefits from Adderall, I don't experience it as \"crack\". Nor have I found it remotely addictive. Certainly it's less addictive than caffeine.\nThe general points are fine (schools and workplaces in the US have issues of their own that encourage ADHD-like symptoms), but the details are wildly wrong.","completion":"I'd imagine a lot of that increase has to do with fewer people going diagnosed, rather than more people having ADHD in the first place. People become more aware of the symptoms and realize they can get help, they're less scared of being called crazy, etc. Given how hard it is to tell mental conditions apart (I think I remember reading that somewhere around 40% of psychologists' diagnosis are later changed), there are probably some false diagnosis in there too, where the \"true\" diagnosis is something else that's less top-of-mind, or that hasn't been discovered yet, or is something other than mental disorder.\n> It's fine to say \"change the environment\" but that's not always an option.\n^ good point."}
{"prompt":"So here's what hopefully won't be considered a trolling question: I have seen a lot of \"100% Go\" projects over the past several years and that's usually presented as a big feature. Some pretty trivial things have been redone as brand new in Go, and then suddenly gain lots of attention. What is so magical about a project written in Go vs C, Python, Ruby, Rust, JS, etc.? As a user of the software I won't care what it's written in, if it's done well. If it's done poorly, I am much more likely to look for better alternatives than to fix it (if only I had about 240 hours in a day...), so what's the advantage?\nTo me, an advantage in usability is having a PPA with properly built .deb packages. If I have to use a language-specific package manager that I don't already use regularly, you've likely lost me, unless I really need this functionality. If it doesn't come with a proper daemon mode (correct forking, PID file support, proper file or syslog logging), sample config file, man page, or an init file, that's even worse. I am much less likely to use this in any type of \"production\" environment if I have to maintain those pieces myself. Running things in a screen session is so \"I'm running a Minecraft server\".\nThat is not to criticize your work. You've done a great job! serve2d looks very interesting and I might actually have to give it a try sometime.","completion":"A staid, solid, conservative outlook, a good perspective for others to realize is out there. I would say that concerns like daemon mode and logging are a lot less in vogue these days- a program ought concern itself with running, and outputting to stdout, and if you have needs past these it's expected you have tooling you can deploy that makes that happen.\nDaemonization is at least a fairly standard feature, but with logging there's so many people with such varied concerns that getting fancy, trying to meet people's many needs, can lead to a lot of program bloat very quickly. Instead of going at these on a case-by-case basis, and now that we are more container-centric, it makes sense to run in the foreground and put your output on stdout, let the rest of the system support that utterly uncomplex pattern."}
{"prompt":"I still don't get it.\nYep, unikernels can get away without the security boundary between user and kernel modes... except if you want any security at all in your installation, because at kernel mode people can break out of the container.\nThey can also get away without process scheduling and IPC, but if you want any multiprocessing on the application, you'll need to bring it either on the kernel or the userland. Ditto for user management.\nThey can't really get away without device drivers. Ok, except for devices that you won't use, just like any other kernel.\nWhat is that kernel feature that people take away? Or are they just talking about a stripped down Linux without the device drivers (that fit a floppy disk)?\nThe same applies to the services. What are those services that people gain so much from removing from containers, and why don't people remove them from VMs and real machines too?","completion":"But if the hypervisor already has process separation, quota management, device drivers, etc. there's no point duplicating it all in the VM."}
{"prompt":"Not gonna lie. I thought this was a reference to how long you can leave food on the ground before picking it up and eating it.","completion":"Evidently your floors are cleaner than mine."}
{"prompt":"Each server is single-profile?  If so, I agree that that's a terrible design.  I'd assumed that it was more jabber-like in that anyone could start a server, rather than having to have one.","completion":"Wow already jumping into implementation, the funding is not even over yet.\nHonestly, I am assuming one goal will be to make it flexible. And a second goal and major dev effort (or maybe even a plea for help) will be to make it so a child can use it effectively."}
{"prompt":"I'm half joking, but I'm worried someone will try to sell spaceplane trips to some inhospitable alien desert like Namibia and market it as \"the interplanetary experience\"...\nedit: Actually that could be interesting..","completion":"Death Valley in California is good enough for that IMO."}
{"prompt":">Extra-legal violence is often a part of black markets.\nCurious turn of phrase. Extra-legal violence meaning \"violence outside of the government,\" which implies that there is intra-legal violence, \"violence within the government,\" which may be referring to how the government coerces its citizens to not transact drugs, by means of violence (that is, the government will arrest\/hurt you if you do not comply), and that somehow that is more appropriate or noble.\nAlso it may be somewhat jokingly implying that the government's violence is \"extra legal,\" meaning \"more appropriate with respect to law.\" I wonder if the author had this is mind when they wrote the article. I don't mean to start a huge libertarian rant about government violence\/coercion, only to point out that the sentence could have a clever hidden meaning.","completion":"It means that for black markets transactions, which are made illegal by the state and thus impossible to discuss in the open, more peaceful ways of settlement (e.g. arbitration) are not available.\nThis implies that instead of a doctrine of proportionate response, you end up with a binary system where you either get away with petty theft until you don't, because the guy you steal from has had enough and wants to end you.\nIn concretu: If Silk Road was legal, the owner would have reacted with a lawsuit in the court system. It's not, so he had to resort to violence."}
{"prompt":"About a year ago I switched to a straight razor with disposable single edge blades. I can get a pack of 100 Shark Stainless Steel blades for just over $5, and I usually change them out every 3 shaves or so. I skip a day every now and then, so all of my shaving needs are taken care of for $5\/year.\nAfter a week of practice, the straight razor is just about as fast as any typical razor, much closer shave, and less irritated skin.","completion":"I switch to wilkinson sword (schick) while without a razor in London. Much better than Gillette.  That said, once those blades are gone, I'll likely try shark blades soon.  That said, a decent razor that doesn't require all the soap etc is less to carry while traveling."}
{"prompt":"The problem of re-designing something as popular Wikipedia (especially something useful that has not changed in 10 years!) is that regardless of the result (i.e. better or worse), you will face _fierce_ opposition. Humans are very sensitive to anything that changes their mental model of how they think something should work.\nThink about radically updating some of these to see what I mean:\n- Facebook Newsfeed\n- HNs homepage\n- Vim interface\n- Google Search Page\n- Craigslist homepage\n- Your favorite web mail client\n- Your favorite Smartphone main screen\n- Reddit homepage\nYou can come up with the most amazing forward-thinking improvement, and somebody without a doubt will send you so much hate that you'll think it is that person's only goal to wipe out your family line.\nThis doesn't mean we shouldn't do it, it just means that we have to be aware of that section of the population and come up with a strategy that either does 1) a slow migration for the people with old mental model, 2) provides an alternative \"classic\" view, or 3) completely ignores that section of the population since they may represent a very small minority. I tend to go for 1,2,3 in that order, but of course this can vary differently depending on the project.\nNice job with the re-design by the way :)","completion":"What if your \"forward-thinking improvement\" doesn't capture the reasons the original worked. Then actually you are proposing worse over better, just because it is newer.\nBut you made it, so you won't say that your own baby is ugly ever no matter how many people provide reasoned arguments"}
{"prompt":"I don't use foreign keys because they've bitten me in the ass too many times. I can maintain data integrity in the app level so I do it there. Adding FKs to the mix means my DB is also doing the work I already have to deal with in the app and that's use slowing things down.\nFKs are a kind of business logic and I want none of that in my DB. I want my DB to give me storage, preferable ACID storage, and nothing more. I'll keep my business logic in my app.","completion":"Wow, I can't fathom how this works. Where do you store the relationship, then? Say you have posts and comments. I would want a posts table and a comments table, with a post_id foreign key in comments. How would you do it without a foreign key?"}
{"prompt":"This.\nIs it really a surprise that the Python VM is not performant? I thought everyone knew that by now. Any reasonably well engineered VM (e.g. V8, JVM, Go) will blow it out of the water. This should be well known to anyone who calls themselves a software engineer.\nThe Disqus system could have been written in a large number of other languages and have performed more or less the same as the Go system. The only advantage I can see of Go is that it's reasonably close to Python\/Ruby in terms of semantics. If Python or Ruby is your only tool then Go might be a good choice. Not so if, for example, you're more into the functional style.\nEdit: Ok, so Go doesn't use a VM. It still has a runtime, as all languages must. Substitute runtime for VM above as appropriate. Point still stands.","completion":"Yes\nThen try PyPy"}
{"prompt":"It saddens me that people are bothered about this. It highlights the continued disconnect between the interests of the companies traded on the market and those of the investors at large.\nBezos has been completely transparent about his philosophy regarding long-term and short-term profitability. This is not out of character for Amazon. Rather the opposite: the day I hear Amazon cutting long-term projects to boost short-term profitability is the day I would sell my Amazon stock. This is the way Amazon has operated for most of its history. They've already built up enough of a track record for us to trust that they know what they're doing. It is stupid to expect them to behave like other companies when we have seen them operate in this manner for some 20 years successfully. Maximizing short-term profitability is not a high priority for Amazon, and it never has been. Why is the market surprised then when they re-invest in growth? Because the market can be stupid.","completion":"\"Bezos has been completely transparent about his philosophy\"\nI don't know if this is transparency as much as controlling the narrative and preempting and spinning potential criticism. Rhetoric. This is often done in marketing whereby you take a disadvantage and turn it into an advantage in the buyers mind.  \"Sure we charge more because we take the time to hand craft ...\" instead of \"we can't afford the same people and machinery and distribution to make our product cheaper and widely used ...."}

{"prompt":"\"They had been completely priced out!\"\nThis is a fallacy.  People use this term \"priced out\" as if it meant some sort of process, but it means nothing more than that the investor thought the startup's stock was too expensive.  And it is very stupid to let valuation decide which startups you invest in, because the variation in outcomes between startups is orders of magnitude greater than the variation in valuations.  I.e. there is no value investing in startups.\nWhat we have here is a case of anecdotal evidence.  A founder happened to get some investors who hadn't invested in other startups because they felt the valuations were too high, and those investors turned out to be really helpful.  But there are other investors who are willing to invest at high valuations who are helpful, and investors who seek out low valuations who aren't.","completion":"The phrase might be a fallacy, but the idea is not.  Founders often think about getting investors to pay a premium for a great startup.  However if your goal is to get helpful investors, founders should consider paying a premium to get the investors that they want on board.\nOf course this only works if you are capable of choosing investors well."}

{"prompt":"I'm conflicted.  As a (heavy) consumer of HN, not having the best comments called out to me has made it more difficult to parse, and not being able to sort searchyc results by points will eventually diminish its value as external memory for me.\nAs a producer on HN, I have noticed two things: one, the subjective self-assessed quality of the comments I have been writing since the change has been far higher than it was in the few months prior to the change.  I've been quipping less and writing meatier, substantive, useful things (I hadn't stopped writing those, but there were periods of weeks where I had no comment longer than a paragraph and very few actionable bits in those comments).  I do not know why this is -- it could be phases of the moon, totally unrelated to the interface change, for all I know.\nI also note that my per-comment scores for meaty comments are higher than they've ever been, which may or may not be desirable.

{"prompt":"I applaud the effort to try and dissect the problem scientifically.\nIf a whole program has 1 bug due to being implemented with dynamic types over static types, and that bug has gone unnoticed, then it can't be particularly important.\nThe other common proposition is that dynamically typed languages are faster to write in than statically typed languages. If this is true then we need to compare the saving in development time with the cost of the bugs which go undetected.\nMy gut feeling says that this line of analysis is never going to prove that static typing in inherently \"better\".","completion":"An interesting thought: a good type system can actually make a language more expressive.\nA perfect example is QuickCheck. QuickCheck allows you to write complicated tests very simply by relying on the type system. You just write out the invariant and the type system automatically figures out which random generators to use to run the tests.\nQuickCheck has been ported to a bunch of other languages, but it's more complex and seems harder to use in dynamically typed languages as compared to Haskell.\nA simpler example in the same vein is Haskell's read function. Essentially, read is the opposite of toString--it goes from a string to some value. The beauty is that you never need to specify what type you're parsing; it can figure out what type it needs to be thanks to the type system. So instead of having a bunch of functions like parseDouble and parseInt, you have a single read function. This also makes the library prettier by maintaining the symmetry between show and read (toString and fromString)."}

Rolling on MDMA drastically curbed my social phobias. All of my negative social emotions: my neuroticism, my self-consciousness, even bitter emotions such as envy; all of them disappeared on MDMA. Afterwards, I felt as if I'd been cured of a mental illness. While I'm certainly not as outgoing and selfless as I would be on MDMA, I've moved my typical behavior closer toward that. It has made me a healthier, happier human being. More importantly, my interactions help others much more than they used to.\nIt is a tragedy that some parts of the US government try so hard to restrict this drug.

{"prompt":"This technology could be used to cut down on files sizes, to raise video quality and to up resolution. A few thoughts:\n1. 1080p streaming video from Apple, Netflix and others looks pretty good, but it suffers from more compression artifacts when compared to Blu-ray. It simply doesn't look as good. With a more efficient compression technology, streaming video could have similar file sizes to today's H.264 video but look more like Blu-ray.\n2. I already own a laptop that does above 1080p video. When Apple release a Retina iMac or Thunderbolt display it will be around 5k. Other manufactures will be there too. 4k or so TVs and projectors are on their way. Streaming technology makes a lot more sense than a new physical format for higher resolution video. In order to realistically deliver 4k video (or 5k video like The Hobbit is being shot in) over IP, we would need better compression than H.264\n3. Files sizes could be cut down, allowing people to consume more video without going over their caps. This would also allow mobile devices to store more high quality video content for on the go.\nThe best case scenario would be that we get a combo of all three. 4k-5k video content is still a bit way for home use, but when it does come. H.265 sounds like the way to go.\nIn the next few years, this technology could be used to cut down on file sizes some, while also upping the quality of video. This is what we saw with Apple's 1080p video which uses high profile H.264 video, whereas Apple's 720p video is main profile H.264. Yes, the 1080p videos are bigger, but not by much.","completion":"I know bandwidth is a problem, but isn't battery consumption a bigger problem?

{"prompt":"I'm not sure about the other capabilities of the F-35, but judging a modern war plane based on its ability to dogfight is like judging a modern ship based on its ability to ram other ships.\nDogfighting just isn't going to happen anymore in a battlefield where smart munitions are relatively cheap, plentiful, smart, and getting smarter every year.\nWe are talking about skies that will soon be filled with extremely agile drones and missiles.  In that environment, a manned fighter, that cannot pull high-G maneuvers (because the human pilot will pass out) cannot beat a supersonic missile or drone.\nWe should not build planes to perform well in dogfights in the style of the Korean and Vietnam war.  Stealth or unmanned is the way to go.\nHaving said that, the Chinese long-term strategy of developing high performance drones to saturate the battlespace is probably the smartest idea of all.  I don't think any stealth technology remains very \"stealthy\" for very long, in this era of software processing.","completion":"Judging war plane by it's ability of supersonic flight is stupid too. Most air to air missiles are way faster than most warplanes, and missiles have more capability to increase speed if R\/D is poured into it.\nPutting money in radar stealth beyond certain point is stupid too. IR is increasing range, that might be way more important in near future than radar, as it's passive. Also optical tracking and long wave radar with sophisticated signal processing are coming too.\nRadio controlled drones are risky business as the connection can be hacked or jammed.\nIf IR jamming by lasers really hits off, then we are back to guns in dogfight.\nPulling high G maneuvers are BTW not very good indicator of turning ability. High G high speed turn might take ages compared to low speed medium G turn. Modern high power\/weight ratio fighter planes still compete with modern missiles.\nWeird but WWII era Mosquito with IR\/optical sensors and autonomous flying looks like the future. It's cheap, low signature and can't be jammed\/hacked. If you could hire pilots to fly these things cheaper than construct the chips needed, then it might come sooner than 2080.

{"prompt":"Reading this has only further convinced me that Haskell is unsuitable for production due to the difficulties laziness posses to correctly reasoning about the performance characteristics of code.

{"prompt":"Clojure is definitely my favorite dynamically typed language. I also think that its community has a world-class aesthetic sense that other languages (looking at you, Haskell) could stand to learn from. Take maps as an example: Clojure has {\"one\" 1, \"five\" 5} and Haskell has fromList [(\"one\", 1), (\"five\", 5)]. Clojure's syntax is a lot more attractive. Clojure has hyphens and Haskell has camelCase. Again, Clojure wins that one. Also, Leiningen is probably the best build tool I've ever used. I also think that Clojure has a great UX sensibility: once you get past That One Thing (parentheses, which are not as bad as they're made out to be) it's more readable than Scala and arguably Haskell. You can also make Clojure blazingly fast for a dynlang, although with some loss of aesthetics due to type hinting and array bashing.\nThere are two issues with Clojure (3 if you consider static typing a hard requirement, because core.typed is brilliant but probably not \"there\" yet) and both come from the JVM. The debugging experience is still pretty bad; although I dislike debugging in general if it can be avoided, and that's why I've gravitated toward static typing (catch bugs early). The second is that the JVM itself imposes a ceiling on how well you can do performance-wise, and can require a fair amount of configuration in production. Of course, Clojure may be off the JVM in 10 years and, even if not, it's still a great language in very many ways.","completion":"You're saying running on the JVM is a performance issue?  Really??"}

{"prompt":"This argument is somewhat disingenuous. It completely glosses over a huge portion of the issue, that has nothing to do with legal definitions. Namely, stealing deprives the victim of something they otherwise would have, or even more coloquially \"did he take away your stuff?\". Now the crux of the debate rests on this very simple concept.\nIf I take your car, without permission, it is stealing it. Very obviously you have been deprived of your car.\nIf I stay in your hotel, and then decide not to pay my bill, I have deprived you of the 1. the overhead associated with a person's visit and 2. revenue that room otherwise could have generated.\nNow here is the question: when I copy your song, am I depriving you of anything? All the electronic devices are using resources paid for by third parties. You can still sell your song just fine, my act of copying has in no way prevented you from selling the song to other people. I may or may not have bought the song, so it is questionable if I am even depriving you of money you otherwise would have made (assuming no-fee copying, e.g. torrenting).\nSo, all that explaining to get to a \"maybe\" answer to \"did he take away your stuff?\" when applied to copyrighted data (a song).   Now, there is some more nuance than even that: if I sell your song, I am obviously depriving you of money people are willing to pay for it. If I give away your song tho, there is no money I am depriving you of -- the people who gave me $0 are not guaranteed to give you the asking price without my giveaway. Further, how much of my giveaway is made up for in increased popularity? Could I charge back with a \"stolen services\" suit, declaring that my giveaway of your song helped push it to number 1, therefore you owe me marketing fees?\nBasically, yes, some people get caught up in the legal definition aspect, but that is because the legal definition argument closely mirrors my question of \"did he take your stuff\". I do agree though, that maybe we nerds should come up with a good way of discussing it w\/out invoking lawyers anyway.","completion":"> Now here is the question: when I copy your song, am I depriving you of anything?\nYes, because there's a chance -- say, 5% -- that you would have bought it. So, you're depriving me of wealth and money.\nBuying music, software or any other digital good is a contract, a promise: I promise you a copy of my music, you promise to pay me money and don't copy it for others. If you don't like the conditions of the contract -- fine, buy elsewhere!\nBut if you agreed to the conditions, violating them is immoral."}
{"prompt":"IMO, including home chargers is fine (if it were common practice for people to have gas pumps in their garages those would be fair to count as well), but to be a fair comparison, I think you need to count the actual number of gas pumps in total, and factor in the difference in \"charging\" time between the two technologies. So if there are an average of 6 pumps at each station, and if it takes two minutes to gas up an empty tank versus 30 minutes to fully recharge an electric car, then you really need 75 times as many charging points to claim you have something resembling equality.","completion":"Assuming 100% utilization of course, which around here is very far from the truth."}

There are a bunch of rules for revenue recognition, and one of them is that if the customer perceives the driver as being an agent of Uber, then the recognized revenue is likely the entire fare.\nIf a customer has a problem with a particular driver, they contact Uber, they don't contact the driver directly.  This is a key fact that makes a strong case for recognizing the entire fare as revenue.\nThe difference with Groupon is that the customers were still interacting with the end merchant, ie. whoever supplied the coupon, as opposed to Groupon as a whole.\nOne problem with recognizing the entire fare is that their margins will look a lot worse.","completion":"Isn't what's being called revenue in this article comparable to what ebay recognizes as \"gross merchandise volume\"?"}

That would push more people towards open source and alternate solutions.

{"prompt":">If you feel like the type system fights against you, chances are that you are doing something wrong.\nLike most things, I think this depends on context.  Doing exploratory data analysis in a static, strongly-typed language, for example, is extremely painful.  And writing quick, one-time scripts in such languages is usually more trouble than it's worth.  For this reason, Python is a wonderful language for doing data analysis and writing quick one-time data munging scripts (and yes, I realize that Python can be considered strongly-typed).\nOn the other hand, I've now been exposed to languages like OCaml and Rust, and have had time to think about Java, and I now have a different attitude when I'm building a large application that will have to be maintained.  I'm beginning to feel extremely vulnerable when I use a language like Python or (worse yet) Javascript to build such applications.\nIt's not that I'm not a Javascript hater.  I like Javascript in general -- it has a kind of functional feel to it, it's easy to prototype quickly, you can use it client and server, nice ecosystem, and unlike so many I actually enjoy async programming.  And I've long enjoyed Python for similar reasons.\nBut for building a robust application that will have to be maintained a long-time, you have to religiously write tests in these languages or you'll be buried in bugs.  And even then, you still may be buried in bugs that a static, strongly-typed language would have detected.  For this reason, I'm looking hard for an static, strongly-typed alternative to Javascript for the browser (i.e., a language compiling to JS) for building large applications.  And Ocaml's js_of_ocaml is definitely on my list of things to evaluate.\nSo the programming language philosophy that I adhere to now is encapsulated in the hackneyed old saying \"use the right tool for the job\".","completion":"Dart is a language worth considering if you want something with static types that compiles to js."}

I don't think so.  They'd just be bummed that their apps stopped working.","completion":"I don\u2019t think that would magically make them upgrade either, although they might be willing to do so since the only thing we can do is not upgrade our apps to support them.\nObviously this will vary from app to app, but I\u2019m surprised that you have such a high number of users with an older version of iOS. Is that across all of your apps\/games?"}
{"prompt":"As I've been reading the coverage of this product throughout the day, the price seems to be the biggest drawback everyone focuses on, and I agree that $1100 is overpriced for what this product is offering. I got the sense from several articles that $1100 would be way overpriced for any e-reader.\nBecause of the huge number of PDF files in larger paper sizes that I have, I'd happily pay $1500 for this if in addition to it's features it: 1. wasn't made by Sony, 2. was color (to about early 1990s Newspaper quality), 3. was unlocked (different OS could be installed, etc)","completion":"Why don't you want it from Sony?"}

{"prompt":"Why don't they just put a camera filming downwards to determine the ground speed? Wouldn't it be simpler and more reliable?","completion":"Reasons I can think of include: the ground does not consist of a regular pattern of known length so image processing might be more difficult; looking out over the track allows more data points to be interpreted; an outward looking camera can fulfill more additional roles or be repurposed to compensate for other failed instruments more readily; a downward facing camera is more likely to gather images within the rover's own shadow; other outward facing cameras could use the same algorithm should the distance measuring camera fail."}

For example, someone in this thread cited an NPR article titled \"When Women Stopped Coding.\" Does \"coding\" sound like a prestigious job activity to you?

{"prompt":"This is a three-pronged stroke of genius:\n1) Immediate benefits to just about anyone. If you have your own solar panels, you need this (or something like it). Even if you don't, you can benefit by drawing more power during cheaper off-peak times.\n2) If lots of people get in on this, we'll have the storage capacity we need on the grid to be more dependent on renewable energy. Lack of storage capacity is one of the biggest obstacles to increasing renewable generation.\n3) If lots of people buy this, the price per unit goes down, and it's the most expensive component of Tesla's main product, their cars - which are effectively batteries on wheels.","completion":"It's a good idea; I would place it more in the \"obvious\" category than \"stroke of genius\" but it's clearly got a market.\nI think that the technology to do (2) at grid scale is far from ready. The grid was built to distribute power from generating stations out to users. It was not designed to have power flowing into it from thousands of dispersed battery packs at the tips of the network (i.e. residential service points). Significant reengineering and investement will be needed to make this really workable."}
{"prompt":"I feel the same.  I love the ease of Heroku but the premium cost is high.  Given the fierce price competition among VPS providers like digitalocean, I've always wondered why there are no cheaper alternatives to heroku.

Either that or the button is simply a placebo.\nFortunately, the false positives for personal correspondence from individuals are still extremely rare, at least for me.","completion":"How easy is it to unsubscribe from those newsletters? Is there a one-click unsubscribe link that doesn't require you to login or enter anything before unsubscribing you?\nIf I've subscribed to a mailing list or newsletter and there isn't a one-click unsubscribe I'll click the Spam button to get it out of my inbox instead of going through their procedure.\nOne-Click Unsubscribe is paramount for mailing lists and newsletters not getting marked as Spam."}
{"prompt":"Technically, BitCoin is hardly scalable.\nAs every participant needs to be aware of every transaction, that gives O(N^2) computational\/storage cost, assuming N is participants and transactions~participants.\nMay be cured by a dedicated central server storing all the transactions, but then it is not P2P anymore.","completion":"I don't think that's true. Clients just need the latest block (and a few blocks after) to verify that a transaction has gone through, only nodes (which are meant to be quite computationally powerful) need the whole block chain."}
{"prompt":"I guess none of you has ever set foot in a coffee shop in Italy. Compared to that Starbucks is the most inefficient place ever.\nI'd like to have hard numbers to prove that, but the sheer fact that one espresso is about $1 in Italy, the cost off coffee is comparable and the cost of land is much higher than in the US, makes me think that Italian baristas are at least twice as efficient.","completion":"IIRC, they also to use the two-step method. You pay at the register and then go over to the person making coffee and give them your slip that says what you ordered.\nAs far as pricing, I don't think you can make a living selling shots of espresso for $1, unless you sell an awful lot of shots or sell a lot of other things."}

{"prompt":"The note at the end about the lack of advertising, the lack of a free \"lite\" version and the $4.99 price point are, IMO, the red flags (aside from the whole \"not everyone is going to get rich off of the app store\" thing).

I'll drop $2 on an app if it seems decent, but I probably wont' spend $5+ unless there is I think it will be exceptional.","completion":"From my (very limited) experience, price has little impact on sales.

{"prompt":"If the data is indeed valid, it might have less to do with the privacy concerns and the ads, I don't think mainstream users care about either that much.

But the average person is mortified at the prospect of their private business going out to the world at large. \"The Internet\" is a bugaboo to many, many people with privacy violation being a part of that bugaboo. This same dark, nameless fear is starting to rub-off on Facebook.\nThat said, I would agree that the other compulsive aspects of Facebook you mention probably also are factors.

Period.\nAutomatic parallelization is very possible. The problem is tends to be less efficient. A decent developer can often do a better job than the compiler by performing manual code restructuring. The compiler cannot always determine which changes are safe without pragmas to guide it. With that said, our top compiler devs did some amazing work adding automatic parallelization to some awful code.\nWe inevitably sold our supercomputers because we had application experts who would manually restructure the most mission-critical code to fit cache lines and fill the vectors. Most other problems would perform quite adequately with the automatically-generated code.\nWhat this article lacks is a description of why Erlang is more uniquely suited to writing parallel code than all the other natively parallel languages like Unified Parallel C, Fortran2008, Chapel, Golang, etc. There are so many choices and many have been around for a long, long time.","completion":"Fortran (especially ancient, wheezy Fortran) lent itself to supervised automatic parallelization because of its lack of dynamic arrays.

Sure, words may simply be bad, but they alone usually cannot make song good or bad, while music composition and performing definitely have this power.\nAlso, please do not think of Americans that way.

For Earning to Give at Goldman to be net harmful, the marginal employee would need to be causing the death of a hundred people each year. This would mean that Goldman Sachs employees are several orders of magnitude more deadly than American service people in Iraq.\nGoldman has 32,000 employees. An upper bound for the harm caused by the marginal employee is thus the total harm caused divided by 32,000. For the harm to outweigh the good, Goldman would therefore have to be killing at least 3.2 million young people each year, or doing something else that is similarly harmful. That would mean that Goldman Sachs would need to be responsible for around 5% of all deaths in the world.

The New Horizons mission to Pluto, for example, is powered with 10.9 kg of plutonium that provides a steady 228 watts and enough heat to prevent the kind of cold-related damage we fear happened on Philae.  That mission is so far from the Sun that it wouldn't even be possible with only solar panels.","completion":"The so-called \"green parties\" have caused a lot of environmental damage to Europe and the earth.

{"prompt":"Yes, it is, without a doubt. It's one of the most universal tricks of the trade that you'll literally never regret learning, mainly because just about any environment you'll ever work in will by necessity support regexes, and in many, it will be the primary way you interact with text.\nBut it's also a must that you realize that despite the fact that they're exceptionally useful and widely supported, regexes are a disgusting abomination, one that we should be absolutely mortified to be associated with. It's one of the worst syntaxes to ever be invented, and every one of us should feel the cold stink of UX failure wash over us every time we write a regex. If we ever catch ourselves writing a DSL that in any way, shape, or form resembles regular expressions, we should stop immediately and ask what the fuck is wrong with us and why we're being so opaque and random. Regular expressions are quite literally one of the worst syntaxes to ever be introduced in our field.\nI worry a lot when someone doesn't know regular expressions at all. But I worry far more when someone thinks they're beautiful. That person has far too high a tolerance for unintuitive syntax and code, and will cause vastly more damage to my codebase than even the rank amateur that still uses \"goto\" on a regular basis.\nWhich is not to say that we shouldn't lean on regexes heavily anyways when they're appropriate - as programmers our primary job description is that we're paid good money to work with shitty interfaces in order to express simple ideas and algorithms.","completion":"I think that regular expressions have a good syntax for most typical (small) uses of regular expressions. Maybe the choice of special characters isn't ideal, and it might be nice to have 'English' versions of more special characters (similar to e.g. [[:digit:]] in POSIX), but for small regexes the (mostly) one-to-one mapping between characters in the pattern and characters in the string is a very nice and intuitive syntax.\nI think the real problem is that we lack (or don't learn) good tools to bridge the gap between regular expressions and 'custom parser'. We're reluctant to refactor from '1 line of just-starting-to-be-horrible regex' to tens or hundreds of lines (depending on language and libraries) to do it 'properly', and so we end up stretching regular expressions beyond the point where they make life easier.\nPerl has Parse::RecDescent (and probably several others), which is pretty close to the right thing, and clearly it's very doable in a lot of languages - anyone got any suggestions in other languages?"}

The rear view mirror has two positions: one for day-time and one for night-time (which dims the brightness of other cars' headlights).\nThere's a manual switch which accepts two position and which is located on the back of your rear view mirror.\nIt's something you need to switch manually twice a day: once in the morning to put it back in \"day mode\" and once at night, when it becomes dark. You don't need to reconfigure anything: the position of the rear-view mirror stays correct and you continue \"viewing the same thing\", just dimmed enough as to not be blinded by bright headlights in your rear-view mirror.\nHonestly, as I wrote earlier, most people I know who drive cars are totally unaware of that switch even though they're driving since 20 years."}
{"prompt":"Not to be hyperbolic, but the continual promotion of the \"module\" pattern in JavaScript is some of the worst advice you can give.\nJavaScript has prototypes for a reason -- use them. By using the \"module\" pattern to build objects, you create a separate copy of every function for every instance of every object you create. If you're just creating a handful of objects, it's no big deal, but if you're creating a large number of objects, it's horribly CPU and memory inefficient.\nModern JS runtimes like Chrome\/V8 can create and store a million small objects with prototypes and \"new\" in a couple seconds, using just a dozen or so megabytes of RAM. Creating the same million small objects with the \"module\" pattern takes minutes, uses many hundreds of megabytes of memory, and often crashes the browser.\nAnd that's just the pragmatics -- there are deeper semantic reasons to use real prototypes.","completion":"You are not being hyperbolic.

Once Steam is installed, it's the same experience as on Windows.\nAs far as things like Nvidia drivers go, it's also very easy with Ubuntu.  Peripherals are mostly plug and play.\nAs long as you don't have extremely old, obscure hardware, it will be a very easy, smooth experience.\nAnd installing Ubuntu on a computer is much easier than setting up OSX\/Windows to double boot..."}
{"prompt":"Why, There a lot of organizations that have allot of invested time, training and code-base in Java.

One thing that strikes me as completely absurd is that the plea deal is for a substantially lower sentence and that if the plea deal is rejected the prosecution will go for a much higher punishment, sometimes as much as 10 times as much as offered in the deal. It would seem to me that if you offer a guilty plea that is 10% of what you intend to seek that if such an offer is on the record that a small multiple of that (say twice as much) should become the new maximum sentence. It's utterly frivolous to mess around with 90% or more of a sentence just to put pressure on people, that's poker table tactics and we're dealing with people's lives here.\nThe most worrying bit is the part where she says that people will plead guilty to things they did not actually do just to not have the chance at a much worse sentence during a trial stacked against them. This is not about justice at all, it's just a numbers game.","completion":"This. The law should be rewritten to prohibit prosecutors from entering into plea deals of less than X% of the maximum sentence they are prosecuting someone for, with the exception of plea\/immunity deals that include providing incriminating evidence in another case or against another person. Not sure what X% should really be, but it should be sufficiently high as to prevent prosecutors from using the large delta between plea and conviction sentences as leverage.

I seriously doubt that there is no valid research on this because no one has gotten around to it. Too many peoples' businesses rely on understanding programmer productivity inside and out for that to be the case.\nPersonally, I agree with whoever it was that argued that we need to view this as a soft science like psychology or sociology.

The rest are text apps and custom shell scripts for accomplishing tasks in tandem with those apps (such a \"find | random | mpg123\" for shuffling music directories).\nI highly recommend \"evilwm\" for managing such a setup.  Its single-pixel window borders with no window decorations is desktop minimalism as its finest.  It's also got the lightest memory footprint of all the minimal WMs out there.

There are definitely barriers.\nBut I agree with the author that 'women in CS' programs aren't the answer. Success is.

It could be a good thing for economic growth, or it may not be. Let's leave that issue aside.\nThe important thing is that Bitcoin doesn't. Being convertible with other currencies means its value can only rise (following the definition of deflation!)\nSo the only question is whether the rise in relative value - bitcoin inflation - will be faster than the fall of the goods prices' in the other currencies.\nAnd that's where the decentralization part plays its role and the article gives the right answer : if you believe in decentralization and in parties acting in their own best interests, it will be faster.\nIf you believe in centralization and people acting for the others best interest, it won't be faster.\nBitcoin is a fun experiment on human behaviour :-)\nIn the end, bitcoin value will still rise - if only because it provides a way to escape from the deflationary currencies. The only question is how fast.\nThere are negative interest government bonds being sold right now - IIRC, Germany and France do that.\nWhy one would make sure to take a fall when a conversion in bit coin means that the value can be preserved?\nThe question of whether it is a good thing for economic growth remains. It doesn't seems to be.\nI don't have bitcoin wealth. I wish I did because it seems like a very good placement at the moment.","completion":"I don't think you understand how currencies or economics work.\nCurrencies are by nature inflationary in a growing economy.  This is a good thing, because inflation encourages spending and\/or investment.  Deflation is fatal to an economy: because the value of the currency will grow with non-use, deflation inhibits spending and investment.\nBitcoin's fatal flaw is that it is deflationary. At any given monent, you're better off not spending your bitcoins, because that same quantity of bitcoins will be worth more in the future.\nBitcoins other fatal flaw is that roughly half of all bitcoins mined thus far are held in the hands of the inventor of bitcoins and his closet buddies.  They haven't been spending their bitcoins--but they're encouraging others to spend bitcoins as they are mined.  This is close to (but not quite) the definition of a Ponzi scheme."}

What if, as happens in the markets, the shares decline in a big way? The author addressed it briefly in the end but I felt it was half-assed and an overall unsatisfying answer. The government is happy to take $X where X is huge but next year $X is gone on government spending and the refund due to any reason (bad economy, bad company) is basically created out of thin air. Unless the government happens to be better at using $X to create $X+$c than the original holder of $X, the refund has to be artificially created or deducted from other government programs. Nothing new for our government though, especially for amounts as insignificant as billions of dollars when trillions are so easily created. Seriously, justifications like this:\n> A mark-to-market system of taxation on the top one-tenth of 1 percent would raise hundreds of billions of dollars of new revenue over the next 10 years.\ndon't sound very convincing to me at all. All this arguing over a few hundred billion dollars over 10 years? The US government is still spending trillions of dollars each year, we're still trillions of dollars in debt. Maybe the government can keep going for another 100 years in this crazy state, maybe it can't. If it can't, I'd rather get the worst of the possible financial problems over with now and have the US citizens deprive the feds from all sources of income and talk about things like taxes and valid uses of tax revenue from a fresh start with an entirely new government (even cooler, a saner and more distributed approach to government than massarchy).

{"prompt":"One solution that Steve didn't discuss is JSON. To be fair, JSON wasn't that popular in 2005, but it's still a great solution.\nThe way it works is that their are no mandatory newline characters in JSON. Whitespace between lexical elements is ignored, and any embedded newlines in strings can be escaped (i.e. as \\n). So a log format that a few people are using today is like this:\n{'kind': 'foo', 'id': 1, 'msg': 'hi'}\n{'kind': 'bar', 'id': 2, 'msg': 'there'}\nEach log message takes up a single line in the file. You can trivially deserialize any line to a real data structure in your language of choice. You can (mostly) grep the lines, and they're human readable. I do this at work, and frequently have scripts like this:\nscribereader foo | grep 'some expression' | python -c 'code here'\nIn this case we're storing logs in the format described above (a single JSON message per line), and scribereader is something that groks how scribe stores log files and outputs to stdout. The grep expression doesn't really understand JSON, but it catches all of the lines that I actually want to examine, and the false positive rate is very low (<0.1% typically). The final part of the pipe is some more complex python expression that actually introspects the data it's getting to do more filtering. You can of course substitute ruby, perl, etc. in place of the python expression.\nI feel like this is a pretty good compromise between greppability, human readability, and the ability to programatically manipulate log data.","completion":"Err, my formatting got messed up. Pretend like there's a newline between the two log entries I described."}

{"prompt":"San Francisco has no right to compare itself to New York. None at all.\nNew York has a legitimate demand problem, seeing as it's the capital of the world.\nCalifornia has an artificial demand problem due to NIMBYs who corrupt zoning boards, oppose reasonable development at every turn, and live in the past while paying lip service to \"building the future\".\n(It also has a problem with corrupt\/dirty foreign money swelling into the housing market, but that's an issue in New York as well.)\nNew York has solid public transportation. You don't need a car if you live there. People bitch about the MTA, but it's remarkably cheap compared to having a car anywhere in the US, and remarkably convenient considering how much access it provides.\nSan Francisco is a city where you need a car, but can't afford it. Parking costs are so bad that many garages post their 15 minute rates (often around $3.00).\nNew York is hard-core urban and owns the positives and negatives that comes from it, and New York runs itself. San Francisco companies are run from the suburbs-- specifically, from an office park called \"Sand Hill Road\" in a stretch of land that really ought to be reclaimed by the cows and orange trees, because the people living there are contributing nothing but additional work for the sewer system.\nManhattan is what it is, take it or leave it. (And there's nothing wrong with leaving it.) California is fundamentally dishonest and hypocritical, because it's full of people who pretend to be liberal but are, in many ways, worse than the Manhattan old board when it comes to elitism.\nNew York isn't perfect.

{"prompt":"Merging at the last possible moment _increases_ congestion. If there is a lane elimination, after the the lane has been eliminated, traffic speeds up, because there is no remaining merging to complete.  Thus, the earlier merging is completed, the sooner traffic can recover from the disruption.  Also, spreading out the merges over a longer distance, versus everyone merging in the same spot allows traffic to recover from many small distributed disruptions instead of one centralized large disruption.  Early merging = less traffic.","completion":"I've seen this in action even on a pretty long merge segment for a lane reduction.

{"prompt":"Mocks, stubs, shims, etc. are usually just hiding the fact that the code to be tested is terrible, even in OOP languages.\nFurthermore side effects have nothing to do with testing one's code. Why? Because you have to test your own logic, not I\/O or something else. I\/O is already tested by someone else. So you actually don't care where the data comes from - the filesystem or a hardcoded string - you care if the output is correct after the respective transformations are applied to the input.\nAnd when you think about it testing shouldn't be that needed at all. In the OOP world, where state and identity are helplessly tied together and we are not working with values, but with references to values, tests might be a necessary evil.\nIn the land of Functional however writing tests shouldn't be needed, at least in theory. Why? Because if you write small composable functions you should be able to test them right in the REPL. Corner cases? You have to think about them right from the start. TDD forces you to do so - then why shouldn't you when you have the immense power of a REPL? Once a function is ready you are not supposed to change it much. If you do you should change the inner workings and not the input\/output. If you need to change the i\/o most probably you need a different function. But what is more important is that if you needed to change the i\/o and had tests for this function you would actually need to change the tests as well, which is more work (double? triple?) and no added value.","completion":"> tests shouldn't be needed, at least in theory\nTests are very useful for distinguishing between \"what a function does\" and \"what you think a function does\". Especially when you're building on functions written by others. Types and documentation help too, but if someone's already misunderstood something, such descriptive information might still fit nicely with their incorrect world view.\nPersonally, I can't live without QuickCheck :)"}

Anderson Silva, for example, ran a hugely long undefeated streak in which he not only bested his opponents, but often embarrassed them before suddenly falling off the mark twice, and to the same opponent.\nAs a result, he has fallen from grace as the once \"best pound for pound fighter in the world\" to almost average, depending on who you're talking to.  Regardless, his fight record[1] tells the story of a man who simply knows how to win, except against Chris Weidman, and as such, is worth fearing, despite being older than average and much, much better than average.\nThe point that I appear to be dancing around though, is that a guy on a 10-fight win streak seems invincible, while a guy on a 2-fight losing streak seems positively wimpy by comparison.  Looking at the fighter's record on the whole is probably the best gauge of their talent, but as your statistical record approaches the mean, so does the level of fear you might otherwise instill, commensurately.","completion":"Similar to how Tiger Woods looked unbeatable, the \"Tiger Effect.\" Where him just showing up to the tournament made every play just slightly worse because most likely you're playing for second place money."}

I see a slightly different process happening i.e. discovering a new perspective on a problem. A new perspective can be a different way to decompose a problem but I don't think it necessitates anything about the sophistication of the building blocks.

{"prompt":"It's been my worry for a while that we will achieve the marxist workers utopia technically, where the vast majority of work is done by robot, but culturally we will be stuck with a small group of people enjoying the rewards of capital and technology and an enormous group of miserable poor fighting each other to get the rare chance to work.\nEven if you think that such an outcome is 'deserved' for the capitalist and technologist in the short term, in the long term, as the divide grows sharper, I believe most people will come to see that there's something appalling about giving all of the wealth of the world to the descendants of the few and nothing to the rest.  Already one family in the USA control more wealth than approximately half the population.  And this will get starker.\nTechnology enhances power, and we are currently stuck with a system where much more worrying than the 'rich getting richer', the 'powerful get more powerful'.  And the technological concentration of power in the hands of capital goes alongside the concentration of military and political power too.  In the past, when capital got too far ahead of labour, there was always the spectacle of revolution to act as a last ditch moderator and equaliser, but the future will give those in power unprecedented access to surveillance, intelligence and military ability to allow the divide to grow bigger than ever before.\nWe need to find a way to share the amazing gains that technology brings with labour as well as with capital, and do so in a way that doesn't disincentivise the creation of new technology, and we need to start coming up with this really soon to have any chance of heading off a disaster.

{"prompt":"While I agree with the spirit of the article, this is one of those cases where a Bayesian treatment is conceptually much clearer.\nAssume that ratings are being generated by a stable stochastic process where the underlying distribution is multinomial (ignoring the ordinal character of ratings, for the time being) and use a dirichlet conjugate prior.  This gives you a posterior distribution over new ratings for an item.  The benefit of a posterior here is that it lets you rank items by thinking in terms of the probability that the viewer would rank one item higher than another at random.  By adjusting the magnitude of the alpha parameter to the dirichlet prior, you adjust your sensitivity to small numbers of observations.  A small initial alpha will lead to rapid changes in the posterior upon observing ratings, whereas a large alpha requires a significant body of evidence.\nThe best part of the multinomial model with conjugate dirichlet prior is that the math is REALLY simple.  The normalizing constant for the dirichlet distribution looks scary when stated in terms of the gamma function, but given this is the discrete case, just pretend everywhere you see the gamma(x), it is replaced with (x - 1)! and you will be ok.\nLet me know if you would like to learn more, I would be happy to help.","completion":"What he said!  I'd like to add that a key to squeezing more out of NathanRice's post is the phrase \"conjugate prior.\"  Another totally natural thing would be to use a Gaussian prior & likelihood, then update the posterior as ratings arrive.

This is a really commonly held viewpoint that I think is the product of our fast news cycles, and I don't think it approaches truth for another several years.\nYou are totally right that iPod and iPhone were not the first. While these were cool products when they came out, I think what's often lost is that it was only in the years of incremental improvements that defined how important these products were.\nTons of use cases are being unlocked in health, education, home automation, transportation, payments, enterprise, etc that these markets have been waiting for and wanting and are truly transformative. They're just not talked about as much, or hit that level of 'omg' for people who aren't dealing with those use cases, but they're real. The less sexy incremental stuff is amazing, and in fact, way more interesting because so few companies get the details right.\nJust like you're saying about not being first, most blow-your-mind ideas that will come out in the next 10 years are probably already thought of, prototyped, or launched in some highly crippled form to an extremely limited audience. Two amazing things we can assume are in the pipeline are:\n1. Driverless car, which will fundamentally change our transportation infrastructure.\n2. Eye tracking and face tracking, which unlock new interaction paradigms that are even more natural and seamless. See the recent Faceshift acquisition [1] for evidence.\nThese are going to be awesome!

Yes, some grannies would be forced to sell their homes because their property taxes would go up beyond their ability to pay from their fixed income, but the overall effect would be positive. A side benefit of this would be that we could fund our schools again.\n2) Cities could repeal rent control laws. If owners are forced to pay property taxes that reflect the true value, there's less likely to be an imbalance between the value they get from renting and from selling the property.\n3) Cities should allow the building of more housing regardless of complaints of existing residents. Repealing prop 13 will also help with this, since there will no longer be a direct financial benefit to existing homeowners to block new construction at all costs.

No amount of government meddling will fix that problem...the only thing that will is correcting that imbalance by increasing the supply of housing."}

I think that Stefan Molyneux (or however you spell it) is right on when he says that bitcoin is \"a revolutionary protocol for information synchronization.\"  However, it is by no means unique, and as we've seen, anyone can start their own bitcoin-type cryptocurrency.  Apparently, the Canadian government is working on their own, and I don't think it will be long before other central banks begin to follow suit by adapting the bitcoin protocol for their own purposes and presumably solving some of its myriad problems in the process.

On the other hand, I've also learned that if everyone is expecting something to do one thing, it usually does the opposite, and it seems that pretty much everyone agrees that bitcoin is in a bubble.

{"prompt":"Discriminatory behavior (sexist, racist, etc.) often persists, in my experience, because the perpetrators don't realize what they are doing. It's not that they think, 'I want to exclude women from tech jobs'; they blindly follow old patterns of hiring and other behavior. Humans naturally are very egocentric and have to work to see things from others' perspectives. When they do, they change; most people don't want to be sexist.\nSo of course many think it's meritocratic; they don't see the obstacles because they never experienced them. And of course some think they are victims of persecution; they don't see what they are perpetrating.\nHere's an intellectual way to approach the problem: Stepping back from our society, if a system is truly meritocratic then why would 38% of a population[1] produce 90%[2] of the winners? And is it coincidence that the 38% group has controlled power, wealth, and privelege for hundreds of years, and still does in most other situations (governnment, non-tech business, etc.)?\n[1] U.S. population is 77% white, so I estimate 38% white male. http:\/\/quickfacts.census.gov\/qfd\/states\/00000.html\n[2] Wild guess at the % of SV tech workers that are white male.\nEDIT: Minor rewording for emphasis","completion":"I wasn't defending any particular practice as being perfectly meritocratic.

And is it coincidence that the 38% group has controlled power, wealth...\nUsing google\/twitter's easily googleable demographic numbers as representative, white males only make up about 42% of the \"winners\". Google\/twitter are 60% white and 70% male, 70% of 60% is 42%. White males are only marginally overrepresented. It's actually Asian males who are wildly overrepresented - they make up 21% of google\/twitter (70% of 30%) and 2.5% of the population. Are Asian males 8x more privileged than whites?\nAn alternate hypothesis is that merit is not uniformly distributed and Asian males simply have more of it.

Inciting a war on false pretenses, aiding the administration in violating the Geneva convention, and violating civil liberties via warrantless wiretap have nothing to do with Democrats vs. Republicans.\nThese things aren't controversial political stances, they are international crimes.  People are outraged at her appointment to Dropbox because there's a large body of evidence suggesting that she's a war criminal, not because she's a Republican.\nDomestically, we've somehow decided that the Iraq war is a moot point, something better left in the past.  But internationally, where our former president has actually been convicted of war crimes in absentia, you can't just lamely pretend that this is just a matter of \"different strokes for different folks.\"\nIt's comforting to frame this as a political issue rather than a criminal one, because the alternative is too exhausting and frightening to grapple with.

Crimes are defined by politics - thus war criminal and international law are completely political. Similar to how someone can say \"Aaron Swartz's case is not political at all, he violated criminal hacking laws!\" And yet at some point, politicians decided to enact the laws that criminalized his behavior.\nSimilarly, someone has to set the laws for war as well, to define what a \"war crime\" and \"false pretenses\" are.\nEveryone believes his or her point of view, that one specific version of war crimes is correct and above the realm of politics. Ultimately though, everything is \"different strokes for different folks\". Abortion? Killing unborn children, or denying women's rights?\nWho has convicted any of George Bush, Condoleezza Rice, etc. for war crimes?\nAnd who ultimately gets to decide and enforce the actions of an international court?

No one has a big enough army to put Americans on trial for any war (bet it Vietnam, Korea, Kosovo, Iraq)\nThe one thing I agree most with is that Rice's actions are far more substantial and far-reaching than Eich's. On her imaginary resume somewhere is presumably \"Secretary of State\" and everyone's mental bullet point of \"Iraq War\"  - that is part of her professional career and she should be judged upon that for job fitness.

{"prompt":"Salt\/Puppet\/whatever. I ignore them all. Why? I have put a lot of thought in to this area.\nIMHO, the overwhelming problem with salt\/cfengine\/puppet style solutions (which I will refer to as 'post-facto configuration tinkerers', or PFCT's) is that they potentially accrue vast amounts of undocumented\/invisible state, therefore creating what I refer to as configuration drift.\nIMHO, a cleaner solution is to deploy configuration changes from scratch, by deploying clean-slate instances with those changes made. In addition, versioning one's environment in this way creates an identifiable point against which to execute automated tests. (This class of solution I refer to as 'Clean-slate, Identifiable Environments' or CSIES.) Examples are Amazon AMI's, and any other kind of versioned\/identified VMs.\nPFCT's deployment paradigm tends to be relative slow and error prone. CSIE's tend to be fast and atomic. PFCTs are headed for the dustbin of history. They are temporary hacks that clearly grew from old-school sysadmins' will to script. CSIEs embrace modern day devops, as more holistic entities that embrace virtualization and recognize the integrity of the environment as critical to preventing ridiculous numbers of environment-induced, service-level issues that are an expensive tangent to service development, testing and deployment. Thus, I would argue that what we are looking at with PFCT's is a failed paradigm, and with CSIEs, the now real and current opportunity for something far more elegant.\n(Disclaimer: Haven't tried ansible or vagrant first hand, but they do seem to be PFCT's to me.)","completion":"I also think that rebuilding from scratch is way better than some idemponent CM solution.

Now I'm setting up a system where I will have portable containers for specific tasks - a nodejs container for a webapp, a postgres db, tor machine for anonymous work, etc. All of them will be built using Ansible and versioned using git.\nThen I can put them all on a vps and redeploy independently and just use one machine."}

It did exactly what it was supposed to: it gave you data. It didn't fit your expectations? Good, now you have a tool to refine your expectations. But instead, we see PhD students and post-doc working 70h hours week on experiments with seemingly random results until the randomness goes their way.\nA lot of them have no clue about statistical treatment of data, making a proper model to try and test assumptions against reality. Since they deal with insanely complicated system, with hidden variables all over the place, a proper statistical analysis would be the minimum expected to be able to extract any information from the data, but no matter, once you have a good looking figure, you're done.

If there is a reason for biologists to make sure that their results are real, they might try to put a little more effort into checking their work.

The Tap-talk feature is an absolute genius for me. This, exactly this, is the perfect non-intrusive yet hyper connected way to intimately stay in touch with someone. Just tap on their wrist, so simple. Make a little scribble to show emotion, so beautiful.\n2.) The digital crown seems very interesting. I know the concerns on this thread, but if you see the demo again, the nob is bigger and is fluid enough to rotate by rolling just one finger on it. We hate crowns on our watches not because we have to rotate them, but because they are hard to rotate. This one might be different.\n3.) The built. It starts at $349, while Android Wear is at $250-300 range. But then this is sapphire glass with at least steel body. And their is mention of actually how a watch is accurate with time, something 3 other companies didn't do.\n4.) Multiple sizes is a good thing. Small people, petite ladies don't like to wear big sizes. I like how adaptive this watch is with the sizes, materials, straps.\nNow on to the awkward parts:\n1.) They gave developers at least 4-5 months time to implement the tap-talk on Android Wear. By the time this watch actually comes to stores, it would be beaten down concept.\n2.) They gave Android Wear manufacturers all the time to step up their game.\n3.) The killer app, even in on-stage demos, seems to be the maps app. The Apple maps, unfortunately. That makes it profoundly useless wrist weight for anybody living outside of handful countries it actually works in. That gives Android Wear a terrible advantage.\n4.) No GPS on watch. So basically I have to carry my phone in pocket during runs. There is already GPS apps which do that. So that makes this watch essentially a display.\n5.) No word on battery.\n6.) Apple launched a watch today. A week earlier Moto launched a better looking watch. This is a sentence I never thought I'd say.\nWould I have bought it today if Apple launched it?

{"prompt":"There is a real alternative solution, and it has the virtue of being exceptionally simple: do nothing. The DNS doesn't need to be secured, just like raw IP isn't, nor every individual BGP4 update.\nDANE (using DNS as an alternative to TLS CAs) is the primary real-world use case for DNSSEC.\nNo site in the world is secured purely using ECC DNSSEC, because the roots and TLDs rely on RSA. Moreover: find the most popular site that uses ECC DNSSEC and report back what it is. (It'll be tricky, because very few of the most popular sites use DNSSEC at all). And, of course, the ECC variants DNSSEC uses are already outmoded. Which is why I was careful to refer to modern deterministic Edwards-curve signature schemes. Also: did you really look at the links in that post and think it lacked even \"minimal research\"?\nI don't see any other arguments in this response, but you can call me out if I missed any.","completion":"Note that only SHA-1 and RSA must be supported by conforming DNSSEC implementations; see RFC 4034.  That's probably why support for other ciphers or hash algorithms is inconsistent at best."}
{"prompt":"Not a new idea.

{"prompt":"I can understand the appeal of selling on codecanyon for the existing marketplace you get access to there, but I would consider an independent checkout for the website. Your design and branding are well done and signal high quality, while codecanyon has more of a script\/component flea market feel.

Considering what businesses pay for a service like basecamp, they aren't going to blink if you charge them, say, $250 instead of $45 if the software is good.

This program is very supportive to beginning game designers and helps us to refine our skills and ideas.

{"prompt":"Microsoft spent many years on WinCE before learning that a mobile UI should be different than a desktop UI.  I wonder how long it will take them to learn that a desktop UI should be different than a mobile UI.\nIt's not that windows 8 is terrible - I actually like using it on the tablet they gave out at the build conference, but it's very difficult to use with a normal computer (i.e keyboard and mouse).","completion":"The assumption of Windows8 (and WinCE before it) has always been questionable - \"device agnosticism\" is a fancy way of saying you don't care about your users' experience."}
{"prompt":"Cannabis and opium poppies cannot be used to produce the same end-product. From what I understand, hemp can replace cotton in most end-products; being much easier to grow (and hence cheaper \/ more plentiful), it could potentially flood markets earlier reserved to cotton, hence depressing prices.\nSay you have two farmers; one grows cannabis, the other cotton. Because cannabis is easier to grow, the cannabis farmer has more stock to sell, and if demand from the drug market does not absorb it all, he'll try to sell it on the cotton market, potentially igniting a price war with the second farmer.","completion":"If cotton is an inferior crop, why would we want to keep planting so much of it?\nIn this scenario where hemp & marijuana are legal, cotton farmers could start growing hemp too if that is more profitable."}

Explain BitCoin. Technologies like these may not always be successful, but they are created by people who are very passionate and intelligent. I'd argue that these visionaries are more mobilized than lobbyists, perhaps more passionate as a big cheque isn't being paid to them.\nLobbyists fight wars in self interest, hackers innovate for the people.

I presume that really is statistically significant despite the chance it could have just been random?\nThey also don't know how it works...","completion":"I have to agree that the numbers don't seem to differ significantly enough to draw any conclusive evidence.  I agree with your math in saying that if you had the vaccine, your chance of infection is .6375% and without the chance of infection is .925%.

{"prompt":"In the case described in the story, I don't see any signs of the former. The CFO proposes certain practice, it is not obviously illegal (like not paying taxes or stealing office supplies from competitors at night), hundreds of companies do it, hundreds of lawyers approve it. If the CEO asks the council if it's OK and the council says yes, like hundreds others did, he goes to jail.

{"prompt":"If only. Take e.g. Blizzard's Hearthstone for example, which is made in Unity, so they would literally only have to push a button to support linux, and yet, no linux support.","completion":"I don't think it's that easy. The amount of effort that goes into testing, supporting and getting a game running for another operating system is not offset by the amount of consumers you have in the linux demographic."}
{"prompt":"Could someone with Mongo experience help me gut-check this?\nI want my data store to be durable and unsurprising -- barring a hardware failure or such, if I submit data it should either tell me that it failed to commit or it should be stored durably and without surprises (e.g., it should not truncate a long string to fit).\nI've read some of the Mongo docco, and it's pretty exciting, but the lack of ACID -- primarily the Durability -- has kept me from really using it.\nWith a WAL journal, it sounds like maybe the durability issue is fixed.  Is it?  Could I use Mongo with relatively out-of-the-box settings plus --journal and count on a level of durability equivalent to a traditional RDBMS?","completion":"My understanding is this release is the first stable with single node durability available as an option, which is why I'm considering picking Mongo back up."}
{"prompt":"Interesting.\nNot too long ago I found out that not only does California have incredibly high state income taxes, but it also has really high state capital gains taxes. It actually amazes me that silicon valley has thrived under those burdens which leads me to ask two very important questions:\n1. Why hasn't the high taxes driven people out of Silicon Valley (and will it?)\n2. How is California broke?\nI come from Florida and in Florida, there are barely no state taxes at all because it's all on tourism. Somehow California has these insanely high taxes and still can't pay any bills. Other than blaming illegal immigrants (a dubious politically motivated response), I've never really gotten a straight up answer on what makes California and Florida so different.","completion":"Part of the problem is that California is basically unable to raise certain tax rates without a state ballot measure, and our voters are not big fans of raising taxes. The only way to undo this (IIRC) is to pass a constitutional amendment, since that's how it was established in the first place.\nOur spending and policies are definitely out of whack, as demonstrated in the article, but not being able to raise taxes to compensate isn't helping either. I'm not a fan of raising taxes, but I consider our state being broke to be a bit worse."}
{"prompt":"It looks really impressive and I realize this is a creative showpiece, but is anyone else getting tired of all this \"swiping\" being forced upon users who aren't even using touchscreens?

This is a gorgeous execution of the technique, especially considering the interactive elements (Play close attention the maps portion...really nice 3D effect there).\nAs far as marketing goes I think it beats out the typical static landing page."}
{"prompt":"And thank goodness. If anybody knows where the grave is, I'd like to go piss on it.\nAs somebody who long ago did print design, I totally get why designers would want pixel-perfect control. It is awesome, but you get that in print because you are physically manufacturing an object and sending it to people. The web was device independent from the get-go. It wasn't your paper anymore; it was their screens. There were a couple of designers I came close to beating to death with their own Pantone books because they refused to get that.\nSadly, the desire for pixel perfection led to trying to force every single user on the planet to conform to the designers' weaknesses and fetish for control. For example, every Flash intro in the world. Or all of the goddamn fixed-width \"experiences\" that were either too wide for what users wanted their window to be or so narrow that acres of space were wasted. An approach that surely looked fine in presentation to executives, but much less well for actual users.\nThe great improvements in CSS have definitely helped. But I think the major changes have been the the explosion of form factors (small laptops, giant desktop monitors, tablets, phones) and the rise of a generation of designers for whom the web is a native medium. The old paradigm got harder to force at the same time there were plenty of people who were thinking in a new way.\nPlanck wrote, \"A new scientific truth does not triumph by convincing its opponents and making them see the light, but rather because its opponents eventually die, and a new generation grows up that is familiar with it.\" Design, like science, proceeds one funeral at a time. So goodbye, PSD2HTML, and let's quietly put a stake through its heart so it never returns.","completion":"I wish I could work with people with your mindset.

{"prompt":"Thats the consequence of wasting effort rewriting the screensaver app (and all other basic apps) over and over and over, instead of focusing effort on writing more important things like Adobe CS and the like.\nOnce they fix all embarassing bugs, they'll simply throw everything away and start rewriting everything from scratch again. The main reason Linux desktop is dead is because Linux desktop developers treat it like the latest fashion fad instead of a commercial product you have to live off and be responsible for.","completion":"You are assuming that the same brain pool that writes (re)writes the screensaver, will be just as interested to (re)write Adobe CS for Linux."}
{"prompt":"I remain convinced that C++ warps peoples minds into things like this :-). I'll go out on a limb and say that pretty much ALL of those things are horrible.","completion":"XPCOM is... yeah, it's pretty bad. Writing a Firefox plugin vs. writing a Chrome plugin is darkness vs. light."}
{"prompt":"Also serious ethical problem of targeting such solutions for third world problems is that such products are not really intended to be produced in it.\nReal third world bicycle is same as first world but with hand made steel frame, because frames are most overpriced components:\nhttp:\/\/i.imgur.com\/qpw0a.jpg\nPeople use bicycles for decades and can afford to buy or exchange it by parts ever in third world countries.

{"prompt":"This is the second time I've seen a story on mining hit HN, it always strikes me as a bit odd as the two worlds are miles apart.

We have equipment at Kidd Creek which is the deepest mine in Canada. When I first began to learn about the conditions underground the first thing that surprised me was the temperature in the mines. It's hot!\nIn some mines it's so hot that a human can't comfortably work for long, or at all. AngloGold Ashanti's TauTona mine in South Africa is sitting somewhere around 3.9km (Nearly 13,000 feet). The rock face in TauTona at its current depth reaches 60C. This is where it starts to get even more interesting for me. At these depths is hazardous for a human to work but there remains precious metals at greater depths. The technology to reach it and automate the extraction of these minerals is non-trivial and the current tech isn't advanced enough to reach it reliably.

{"prompt":"Not sure why you were downvoted. Upvoted even though I don't particularly agree.\nHaving lived in Seattle for a couple of years, and knowing many Microsoft employees during that time, my outsider's view is that MS's consumer-side failures are largely geographical and cultural.\nRedmond, or even Bellevue, is extremely isolated from Seattle, which in and of itself is not exactly deeply intertwined with the cultural centers of the US. Locals know this - Microsoft employees who move from Seattle across the lake to the east side often joke about nobody ever visiting them again (sometimes less-than-jokingly). It's also more or less a company town - Microsoft's presence is so overwhelming and absolute that a lot of the technological zeitgeist from the rest of the country never make it there. If you lived\/worked there it's easy to believe Microsoft's ridiculously optimistic PR pieces - pieces that would be hilarious when read in any other environment.\nThis isn't even an urban\/suburban argument (though it has shades of it), it's a \"company town vs. diverse city\" thing. Microsoft's geographical location gives its people tunnel vision and a grossly false picture of the technology sector.\nThe second part I've observed is a lack of internal honesty within Microsoft. Failure seems to be couched in safe corporate-speak to the point where it's greatly muted (maybe that's the intent). You cannot expect your work force to pivot and fight hard when they've been falsely told their giant failure was a minor hiccup. I saw this after the WinPhone launch - MS employees were still honestly bullish about its prospects even when the market as a whole had completely rejected it.\nIf MS wants to be nimble in the consumer space, it needs to set up shop in cities where their competitors play - you will not get an honest impression of how your products (or your competitors' products) are doing otherwise. They also need to have frequent, honest, no-holds-barred accountings of how they are doing. If a product was a flop, call it a flop.","completion":"Based on comments like yours, and general awareness of MS, I think Microsoft has long ago moved from <choose any category you like> to generic mega corporation. In such a company, an individual's success depends on learning how to operate the corporation, and operate within it.\nIt's a destination for MBAs and project managers, not a place to innovate."}

That would probably be okay, if you had an option to take unpaid vacation time when the time comes.  Instead, you're often forced to take a shorter vacation, which doesn't do the job.\nAnd forcing you to work while on vacation is unforgiveable.  It shows that the company doesn't understand why vacation time is necessary.  (I haven't had anyone do this to me, thankfully.  It wouldn't have gone well.)\nIf taking unpaid vacations was an option, I would probably end up taking about 4 weeks worth of vacations, instead of 2.","completion":"Why don't you require this unpaid vacations before signing the contract?

{"prompt":"My version of this, with my Dad, was when I was precocious 16 year old, failing highschool because I was spending all my time hacking code, smoking pot, and girlfriends.  Not a bit of schoolwork was being done, and my Dad was having none of it.\nSo he gave me a summer job.  In the hot Australian sunshine, I was sent off to be a labourer on building sites.  Since I was the young blood, the brickies and other construction types gave me the shit jobs .. moving piles of bricks from one end of the universe to the other, shovelling shit from one end of the universe to the other, getting lunch and ciggies and mud and bricks to the brickies from one end of the universe to the other.  It was monotonous, hot, boring work, and I hated getting up at 5am every day just to get there on time, and work until the sun went down every day, just to go to bed in time to get up again and start moving shit from one end of the universe to the other.\nIt did teach me a lesson, and that lesson - which dear reader I hope you understand - is that work is good for you.  It expands your universe and gives you a life beyond the realms of the little box we're otherwise born with.\nSo, at the end of summer, I took my hard-earned wages, bought myself a new computer, got back to hacking, split up with my girlfriend, and got myself the hell out of that situation.\nAnd I've never looked back.\nWell, now I look back .. because now I'm the Dad, and more than anything else in the world I want my kids to grow up knowing that hard work is good for you, but smart work is better.

Sun discovered that you can get a jump on the competition like that, the first SparcStations really blew away the competition, but ultimately you can't outspend even three other competitors at the same time.\nOf course this was also why Samsung has been a much bigger threat to Apple than the other Android handset makers, they too make their own SoC silicon.\nSo we get to see three companies pursuing products in the same space with three different strategies:\nApple - Custom OS (iOS), Customized Silicon\nSamsung - Third party OS (Android), Customized Silicon\nAsus\/HTC - Third party OS (Android), Third party silicon (nVidia)\nThese kinds of situations don't come around that often so when they do they make for great learning experiences.","completion":"The Sun model ?

{"prompt":"The commoditization (sp?) of your data is what the walled gardens are all about.

They generally have PhDs and years of training in math and whatever particular field they work on. If you get one that is actually doing novel algorithm development, each one is a golden goose that will bring in revenue for the company for years to come.\nBy contrast if you offer a decent salary you can get a good C++ programmer with 3-4 years of experience to do all your C++ grunt work. (we hire CS students from the local University, and bring them up to speed within 6 months)\nWhile not incredibly hard, the problem with learning \"appropriate structure for long term maintainability and production use\" is that it takes an awfully long amount of time.

To be blunt, they can (and generally are) huge assholes, really getting in your face and making you feel like a criminal even when you have nothing to hide. I presume the goal of this is to psych out the people who actually are up to no good, but the end result is that you end up feeling pissed off and unwelcome.\nThat said, I definitely agree that there is another side to this story. For one thing, everything that happens at a border crossing is videotaped from about 14 different camera angles, so there's no way they're going charge him with assault unless he actually took a swing. The fact that the situation even got to that point--multiple guards, pepper spray, verbal commands--means he did something pretty egregious. The crossing guards are dicks but they are professional dicks, at least in my experience. Do as you're told and you'll eventually get through. Ignore repeated commands and project the same surliness back at them and you're just asking for trouble.","completion":"Swiss border guards at airports are worst - esp if your European (like me).

{"prompt":"> believing that because facts or formulas or arguments are easy to remember right now, they will remain that way tomorrow or the next day.\nThis is sad, it confuses education with memorization. I was fortunate in winding up at Caltech, which had a policy of open book \/ open note exams.

On the final exam one of the questions was to derive the hyperbolic transforms. If you understood the fourier ones, you could derive the hyperbolic ones. If not, well, you were lost.\nIn Physics 2, one lecture showed how the characteristics of magnetism could be derived from the idea of electric charges. An exam question was to show the characteristics of electric fields given the existence of magnetic monopoles.\nAnybody can look up a formula in a book, and then misuse it.","completion":"I think the premise of the article is even more relevant for material that requires analysis and application, not just memorization.

From controversial metrics in our S1 to our material weakness to two quarters of missing our own expectations and a stock price that\u2019s hovering around one quarter of our listing price, the events of the last year and a half speak for themselves. As CEO, I am accountable.\nYou are doing amazing things at Groupon, and you deserve the outside world to give you a second chance. I\u2019m getting in the way of that. A fresh CEO earns you that chance. The board is aligned behind the strategy we\u2019ve shared over the last few months, and I\u2019ve never seen you working together more effectively as a global company \u2013 it\u2019s time to give Groupon a relief valve from the public noise.\nFor those who are concerned about me, please don\u2019t be \u2013 I love Groupon, and I\u2019m terribly proud of what we\u2019ve created. I\u2019m OK with having failed at this part of the journey. If Groupon was Battletoads, it would be like I made it all the way to the Terra Tubes without dying on my first ever play through.

{"prompt":"A [somewhat exaggerated] summary: \"there are so many security holes in web browsing already, why do you begrudge us a few more?\". OK, I admit there is a kind of madhouse logic to this which I can't refute. There is already a flood of patches that I need to apply about every 5 minutes to something or other, and that's just the vulns that got identified and reported.\nI certainly agree that nobody will be able to stop this - developers want the API, users want the games.\nWebGL is currently turned on in Chrome 12, and the only way to turn it off is to add -disable-webgl to the command line.  Which essentially means you can assume it's on everywhere, including on the computer of your bank's manager.

I certainly don't think that WebGL is the end of the world. There will be some more holes and some more patches. I just think this is another case of the web development world shirking its responsibility to bring real security to browsing (what happened to all those projects which used virtualization to isolate sessions, which I first heard about 4 years ago?), and instead piling on more features without thinking the implications through.","completion":"\"there are so many security holes in web browsing already, why do you begrudge us a few more?\"\nI think this is a valid argument.\nYou see a lot of arguing about things online where something being slower, more expensive, harder to use, less secure, more radioactive etc. is presented as a case-winning argument, without anyone bothering to quantify the problem or put it in context.\nThe world isn't build on absolutes, unless you can guesstimate how much less secure or more radioactive something will be (a banana worth or a chernobyl worth) then why should I care? If we're really taking the absolutist stance that nothing that introduces a potential security issue (or the slightest additional radioactivity) is allowed then we might as well abandon all technology and go back to living in caves.\nAt least try to make a case that WebGL, if not strangled at birth, will create a noticeably less safe web than would exist in a world with all the current issues, all the ones associated with Silverlight and Flash using GPUs, and all the new issues from whatever other features are added to browsers, computers or smartphones over the same timeframe."}

You will get more Vitamin A but fewer carbohydrates. I\u2019m not sure that this is a good deal in the very poor parts of the word.\nThe problem with the Iron content is easier to see. The banana has to take the Iron from the soil, unless it\u2019s a very rich Iron zone, so you need to use a fertilizer to replace the Iron.

The simple fact that we are aware of our subconscious gives us the profound ability to actually change it - nothing else seems to be able to do this.

They might exhibit strangely human behaviours sometimes because their subconscious can get quiet advanced, but they still can't change it, they have no control over it. When you think of it in those terms, that our concious thought is just this thin veneer that sits on top of our unconscious thoughts (which might make up more of our day to day choices than we expect), it's kinda creepy.

I only see a Company and a Foundation geared to serve a platform namely Ubuntu and not Linux.\nYes Ubuntu is based on a FOSS ecosystem but it does not mean it shares the same goals as linux, whatever the goals of linux are.\nIt means its backed by a company which in my eyes want to bring the wonders of a second unix based operating to the laymen. Only in this one everything is open, and that for me makes sense."}
{"prompt":"To those that think Apple's products are reasonably priced: Where do you think they got all this money from?","completion":"I bought a Jaguar XK because I love the car, the attention to detail and the style. Yes, I could have bought something much cheaper, probably just as reliable (or more so!) but I chose this route as it has a sense of style.  If there's anything about business that I've learned it's that there are products for every niche, be it low cost food through to high priced watches."}

There are also other writers who post under the Babbage name."}

{"prompt":"I've never understood why media players in particular feel they have carte blanche to completely ignore any attempt at integrating with the system look and feel.  I never really got along with WinAMP due in no small part to that.","completion":"I usually agree with you.  I can't stand most programs that don't use a native Windows interface.  Even GTK ones can annoy me.  However, Winamp is the one exception I actually like.  Perhaps partly because you aren't forced to use a horrible, brightly-coloured, sparse interface that many of them get.  Utilities that get forced upon you with device drivers are usually the worst at this."}
{"prompt":"What's with this rash of illegal drug articles? Am I the only one who still thinks it's morally wrong to do something that's illegal, except in certain very special circumstances set out below?\nLet me explain what I mean. There are just laws, and there are unjust laws. Just laws should be obeyed. Unjust laws should be changed. If you think a given law is unjust, you should be campaigning to change it, not breaking it willy-nilly. The cost of people taking illegal drugs is huge, from the drain on police and prison resources to the creation of the organized crime rings which support the drug industry, and if you're taking illegal drugs you're responsible for all of that. If you are correct and drug laws are unjust then... well shit, changing them is an important task for you, and you should get cracking on that.\nRight now there's no great consensus over whether drug laws are just or unjust, but the majority wants to keep drugs illegal, even in California which recently failed to pass (by a huge majority) a legalization of marijuana. If you choose to live in a democratic society, why not obey the democratically ordained laws?\nYes, there are circumstances when it is acceptable to break a law which you regard as unjust. One such circumstance is civil disobedience, where you break an unjust law with the intention of getting caught and punished so that you can bring attention to how unjust that law is, but if you're not (courageously) trying to get caught and punished you're not a civil disobedient. Another such circumstance is if the law is so horrendously unjust that following it will directly harm others, but that certainly doesn't apply in this case.\nIn conclusion, if you want to take drugs then campaign for drug legalization. But don't go round breaking the democratically-devised law in the meantime.","completion":"> If you choose to live in a democratic society, why not obey the democratically ordained laws?\nAs opposed to choosing not to live in a democratic society?

This sounds like a great project and I would love to integrate this into our debugging workflow but this one limitation basically kills that prospect."}
{"prompt":"bloated\n4 gigs of DRAM costs less than $100, today. Who cares if software is bloated?","completion":"People generally don't care if software is bloated if it has a reason to be. If you're not a hacker, you use a computer to run applications, not to run an OS, and there's no excuse at all for a fresh Vista install to consume 800MB of RAM to idle. It drops to 700MB with Aero and Superfetch turned off. Really stupid.\nOn the other hand, my modern, much-more-flexible-and-capable Linux desktop uses 250MB idling at the GUI. With all four workspaces full, Firefox running for multiple days, Sonata, Pidgin, many other apps all going right now, I'm still using barely a gigabyte of RAM. On Vista, that's enough to run the OS and Firefox. Kind of dumb."}

There's no aspect of doom late that would be made less likely as a result of cubicles 1-10 being occupied.\nThe reverse works well, though.

{"prompt":"I'm as hopeful that Apple gets served its own medicine like the next guy, but this seems more like a common sense design rather than a copy.\nIn fact, I once made a mechanical clock that looks virtually identical to the iOS example and this was years before iOS was unleashed on the world. It's just thick lines and thin lines thrown together. The hands aren't even tapered like the Mondaine's.\nThis seems like a desperate grasp from Apple critics, why don't they go after more obvious examples, like the pull-down menus they borrowed from Android?\nHeck, I don't even see all this \"stealing\" to and fro as a bad thing, but rather paradigms moving forward.\nEdit: some people pointed out the red line, which this color-deficient, sleep-deprived person failed to notice.

You can easily debug open source ones, look at their insides and so on.\nThis whole article is really just telling people to use the scientific method in computing too: if you don't know how to reproduce a result it's not science. Fast computation which a human can't possibly do is something that's new from the last 30 years and most scientists still don't know how to deal with it.\nIt is very sad to see that statisticians have switched to R, biologists to python, computer scientists to the gnu tool chain, yet physics and maths seem to have been colonized by mathematica when you have a whole set of open source tools which are superior in every way: pari pg, gnu arbitrary precision libraries, axiom, maxima and sage is you want everything under one roof with a unified interface.","completion":"> That's only true for closed source systems.

Is there profit for the current big players in solving this issue, where as climate change solutions are not so good for current energy supplier? Or something like that?","completion":"How much profit is there in current antibiotics?  Only a few of the newer ones are still patented.  Aren't the bulk of prescribed antibiotics generics?\nI don't think it's because of a difference in the profit to be made by solutions (green energy vs antibiotic alternatives), but rather because of a difference in the profit to be made by the status quo (hydrocarbon-based energy companies stand to make huge profits if they can delay the development of green alternatives until there's a major energy crunch).\nAntibiotic resistance is more obviously traceable to antibiotics use.  The greenhouse gasses link to global warming exists, but the skeptics have leverage against it: Western countries contribute more to global warming per capita (right?), but China and India are contributing more overall; anything we try to do is going to be very expensive and cause a modest slow-down of warming at best; the Earth has been warmer than it is now; global warming models are incomplete; the Earth is a very complex dynamic system that might buffer global warming in unknown ways before we get to a crisis.\nIt's more difficult to argue against antibiotic resistance in bacteria being a problem when we can see resistance develop in a lab, and when we've seen the dire consequences of plagues in documented history."}

{"prompt":"I think writing DSLs for SQL makes little sense.\nSQL is already a declarative query DSL, why not just use it? Putting another declarative layer on top buys you little (syntactic sugar for most libraries, this one additionally seems to deal with one-to-many relations, and I hope that support is read-write, not just read-only) \u2014 and isolates you from the database below.\nIn every serious application I've worked on there was a need to use something which the DSL did not support. So why do it at all?","completion":"In this case, an embedded DSL brings all the goodies of Lisp's code-as-data to SQL."}
{"prompt":"Chomsky's one paragraph quote at the beginning of this article is more clear and thoughtful than the rest of this.  I feel the author's missing the point.\nIn the case of language, observing and reporting statistical probabilities in written\/spoken language output does very little to explain the cognitive systems used in acquiring and using language.  Even one statistical anomaly serves to show that statistical learning is NOT the entire picture when it comes to language development.\nThere was another article on HN a while back that had another great quote from Chomsky that does well to illustrate what I feel is his main point here: \"Fooling people into mistaking a submarine for a whale doesn't show that submarines really swim; nor does it fail to establish the fact\".  Creating a computer that can produce millions of grammatical utterances does little to show that we understand language systems.  Now, if a computer could - like humans - learn to produce infinite, novel, contextual, and meaningful grammatical utterances, that's a different story.  But that story will take a lot more than statistical learning to write.","completion":"There's no doubt that Noam Chomsky founded a paradigm of academic activity.  Linguists can generate an unlimited number of papers and monographs by finding problems and proposing intellectually convincing solutions.\nFrom an engineering standpoint,  however,  Chomsky's view of grammar has been remarkably barren when it comes to machine processing of natural language.  It's made a major contribution to artificial languages but despite a lot of effort it hasn't added much performance to what can be done with statistical methods.\nI'd agree that a hidden Markov model that does POS tagging with high accuracy doesn't provide an intellectually satisfying model for \"how language works\",  but you don't need to have a model for \"how language works\" in order to use it."}

{"prompt":"I think there is a sequence of reasonable thoughts that would justify this design.\nAnyone who has ever run a website with a signup form will know that a surprisingly large number of people are unable to type their own email address correctly. If the email address is wrong, there is no way to contact the user nor to verify their account. So there is some sense in forcing people to at least type the same thing twice, annoying though it is to the majority of us who have no trouble typing our email address.\nIf you don\u2019t know your password, that is recoverable as long as your email address is correct in the system, because you can get a password reset link emailed to you.\nSo it is not entirely unreasonable to conclude that it is more important for the email address to be typed correctly than the password.","completion":"You could also just ask the mail server directly like this: https:\/\/gist.github.com\/poizan42\/2731787\nSure this won't work for every SMTP server as some will just \"OK\" the mail first and send a bounce back later, but neither will the \"ask for email twice\" approach work every time, and at least it guarantees that the domain exists and has a functioning SMTP server."}
{"prompt":"Not correct. Google has begun releasing new version of old things directly into Play Services or as separate new apps, letting the open source version bit rot.\nOne example is the location stack. They have moved into it play services and added a few features, but the open source one is now going to bitrot. 4.4 has now a new closed source launcher, and I'm sure the old GoogleHome.apk will go bitrot in a couple years.\nIf you get AOSP today is quite far from an Android device.

In another couple of years AOSP would probably be irrelevant if you also don't subscribe for the Google apps when you build your device.","completion":"Not true. Google updated a lot of stuff for AOSP 4.4, such as the e-mail app (which I also thought would never be updated again), the Download app, the Gallery, the photo editor, and a few others.

{"prompt":"This article does not prove \"steals everything\" claim. Very shallow work for \"Information Security Specialist\".\nThe reason Dropbox accesses files all over the drive may be that FS events driver generates events for every file accessed by every program, and Dropbox has to read their metadata for some reason (e.g. to check if their full path is under one of synced folders). He should elaborate by checking if Dropbox is actually scanning and reading all drives, which is hardly unnoticeable, or is it something else.\nHaving network activity at the same time does not mean this file has been transferred. It is incredibly hard for me to believe that Dropbox has sneakily transferred >1TB from my various computers without me and my ISP noticing. The author should monitor Dropbox traffic volumes over a week and check if it actually exceeds synced folders size before spreading panic.","completion":"Maybe not file contents, but it could be uploading filenames for whatever reason.\nI'm not saying it is, but your assertion that it uploads all file contents is wrong."}
{"prompt":"I started making a language a few months ago. I found Douglas Crockford's parser from his Top Down Operator Precedence paper pretty useful, which is here: http:\/\/javascript.crockford.com\/tdop\/index.html\nWhen looking for resources on making toy languages, most of them said not to bother with a parser and use a pre-built solution. I think they're probably wrong - the parser is actually pretty easy (relative to the rest of the process of getting a language working) and at a stretch, fun.","completion":"I agree. It's not as hard as one might think. I implemented my own handwritten JS parser using TDOP:\nhttps:\/\/github.com\/higgsjs\/Higgs\/blob\/master\/source\/parser\/p...\nI think it's more flexible and maintainable this way.

{"prompt":"how far ahead of Google would you place the US military in terms of technology, if you had to guess?","completion":"It depends on what you mean, but as a general rule? A very long way. There is far more to military tech than the speculative lab and consumer goods startups that Google has acquired. There is a good reason that the latest fighter jets run software that is ancient by Google's standards: it has to be a 100% rock solid in a deeply hostile environment, it is tightly integrated into other systems, and it builds on many years of practical war fighting experience.\nA company like Google would theoretically have the resources and expertise to begin the process of militarizing their acquisitions, but it would be many years before they could come close to the operational capability."}

{"prompt":"This may be me, but I can't see any company needing a website that costs \"tens of thousands of dollars or more\" not being better off hiring someone for in house work. At the rates people are talking about in this thread, say a $15,000 website design should be taking around 250 hours, or around 2 months of work for a single employee. If you're going to invest a quarter of the yearly salary for a web designer in your site, its probably going to be in your best interest to just hire one so they you don't have to keep contracting out every time you need a change made.\nMind you, I can see the preference towards just doing a one off contract to have it made, but only if your site is going to remain relatively static. Each time you want to make a change to it though, you'll have to re-hire someone to do the work, or try to hack it together in house. If you're going to be actively developing the site though, (I would prefer to) have the designer in house, so he can weigh in during the design meetings for other things too.","completion":"Hiring an employee costs the business a lot more than what they the salary (think benefits, insurance, office space etc....). Where I work, the cost per day of a 'resource' is at least 4x their salary.

Because every time you \"conveniently\" take them off to \"eat or brush your teeth\" your teeth are loose and moving them around hurts like hell when brushing or eating.

Most software engineers don't like charging appropriately or spending appropriately on things that make the company money. There is a huge aversion to sales, marketing, and advertising.\nIf the CEO doesn't make sure the company makes money, the company will fail. I see this a lot in smaller companies.

{"prompt":"Am I the only one who has had terrible experience with Skype?\nI live in New York but my family is from Australia so I use video-calling them to them all the time. I've tried using Skype but basically it's terrible. Poor audio, choppy frame rates and at some point it will start giving messages about \"degraded performance\" and we'll lose video.\nMy setup is a 50Mbps cable line using wireless (N) from a Macbook Pro. The other end is ADSL of varying degrees (1.5 to 10Mbps) on wireless (N) from a Windows PC or laptop.\nWe've basically given up on using Skype.\nWhat works flawlessly and with much higher quality? Facetime.\nAm I really the only one who has had terrible experience with Skype?\nMy point with this is that Skype is not the dominant video medium it once was, especially not from a technical standpoint.\nWhat's more, video calling is becoming a commodity. I think we're near or above 100M Facetime-capable devices (iPhones, iPod Touches and Macs). Google Talk is available to however many millions of GMail users are out there.\nSkype isn't even a strong business (IMHO). Most consumers don't pay, which leaves the business type users who use multiway calling I guess. But where p2p video calling is becoming commoditized, who's to say multiway calling won't quickly follow suit?\nBasically, $8.5B for Skype is nuts.\nIt seems the one who really needed to buy Skype was Facebook who have no video calling to speak of. One wonder if Skype was \"the last piece of chocolate cake\" syndrome, meaning you want something you otherwise wouldn't just because it's the last piece.","completion":"I make regular Skype video calls from Perth Australia to by brother in Mountain View and the video and audio quality is excellent. We both have decent but not stellar bandwidth (~4Mb\/sec at my end) but I think it also comes down to having good hardware."}
{"prompt":"Paris (France). If I could snap my fingers and change one thing about how Americans communicate, it would surely be to stop them saying Paris, France. Or London, England.

{"prompt":"> What would the world be like if contract\/freelance\/part time\/short term work were the default?\nThat's actually one of the reasons I find the idea of a guaranteed basic income so promising. The biggest thing making an \"everybody freelances\" world a dystopia rather than a eutopia (sic) is that it would eliminate any semblance of income stability.\nStatic long-term contracts would still be an option because of the reliability they offer to both sides, but it would give employers the benefit of at will employment without the drawbacks that normally has for the employees.\nOf course I don't really see it happening in the US -- at least not in a way that's good for the employees. A lot of the welfare system in the US is still based on the idea of traditional long-term employment, even with Obamacare and all that decoupling it a bit.","completion":"What's the weekly rate of the average freelance software developer? And how does that compare with that of a freelance bartender, nightwatchman or refuse collector?\nRelying on a BI (at any feasible level) for even a fairly brief period of time is going to represent a severe drop in income for most skilled contractors, and thus people paying mortgages on their condos in SF are going to be just as worried about income instability as before."}

{"prompt":"I just came back from Medellin this week (Monday), and I wouldn't say that Medellin is a tech hub or will be one any time soon.\nI think the most important reason against it is the Internet. It's hard to find even the average U.S. city Internet speed here. Additionally, you won't be able to carry your laptop around the city because there is no concept of \"hot spots\" (The only \"public\" hot spot is the Juan Valdez Cafe, which is the Colombian equivalent of Starbucks).\nAnother major reason is that nearly no one speaks English. If you want to get by, you MUST know how to speak Spanish. This is a huge hurdle, knowing that English is the de facto technology, hacker language.","completion":"Your argument is basically \"It's not exactly like California\". In general, in Latin America, internet access is slower but like all sevices, a lot cheaper than the US, and phone carriers still can afford to offer unlimited 3G plans so people use that instead of wifi. Spanish as a native language isn't a disadvantage -basically every single developer or indeed any techie in the world knows english anyways."}

There is a ton of profit being made from government prisons.\nI always find it bizarre that people point to the 5% to 8% problem - corporate prisons - and think that is the problem, while pretending the huge money that circles around the other 92% - the government prisons - is benign by comparison. The other 92% is even more vile than the 8% corporate prisons - it's 11 times larger."}
{"prompt":"Do you ever stop and think that maybe if people were less lazy and started learning English things would actually improve? Information (including \"important contributions to furthering computer science\") would spread more rapidly, people would have access to an endless stream of news outlets and have a more detailed view of the world.

{"prompt":">  No viable entrepreneurial venture can succeed solely on the basis of what it is logically possible for the technology to someday do, or what it could, in principle, in theory, one day.\nI think the real trick here is to learn how to distinguish between objections that are just examples of people not getting it, and objections that really do point up a fundamental problem you will have to overcome or find a way around in order to succeed. This can be trickier than it sounds.\nA common mistake advocates for new technologies make is to fall in love with their new toy and dismiss any skepticism of its prospects as examples of cluelessness -- often with glib responses like the one in the OP, \"don't hate, create\" (ugh). Not everyone who comes to you with a critique is a \"hater.\" Some of them are coming to you because they have learned something through hard experience that they think will be helpful to you. Ignoring those people can lead you to walk right into the same well-hidden minefields that have blown up countless other bold explorers over the years.

Anything from being a doctor, lawyer to professional athlete.\nSo let's clarify these words before we start the strawmen arguments of \"So lawyers should be jumping for joy and act like Billy Mays in the courtroom, right columbo?\"\nEnergetic (Possessing, exerting, or displaying energy.) - You need to have energy about what you do. Stephen King is energetic about writing horror fiction. He doesn't high-five everyone around him but you can tell he puts his energy into his books.\nExcitement (A feeling of great enthusiasm and eagerness) - What you do needs to excite you. It should be something that keeps you up at night thinking about it. A good surgeon should be excited to learn about new techniques and discoveries in his field.\nConfidence (a feeling or consciousness of one's powers or of reliance on one's circumstances) - You absolutely must know that you are going to sink that next basket. You don't need to walk around like you're the best person at the game but you need to believe that you yourself have the ability.\nSo yes, you need these traits to excel. To argue this is really just leading towards a debate of \"Well I choose a narrow definition of excitement and since doctors aren't that then it is irrelevant\".\nProjection (The act of projecting or the condition of being projected.) is going to be the only thing people can fall back on. I don't believe they are saying to fake some part, but it definitely is not what I'm saying. Having these traits leads to projecting these traits. Your excitement, confidence and energy comes out when you talk about what you love to do. It just does."}
{"prompt":"Consider an alternative scenario: malware.\nIn that situation, as a consumer, I'm actually pretty jazzed about living inside Apple's walled garden on my iPhone. The phone refusing to run unsigned code gives me a little bit more security.\nIt also largely defeats the scenario where I can hire someone to modify my phone's software.  But I'm OK with that tradeoff, because I think it puts me on the side of greatest benefit to myself.  I suspect most non-programmer users would fall in the same camp.","completion":"You should think what malware is. Maybe apple software is malware as well. Anyways if you could review the source code of the \"malware\" you (or people who can read it)could know what it does in advance and avoid it. And code could be signed and verified and still be free software. Linux distros verify software signatures and have almost no malware problems and at the same time use a lot of free software.

But what is this?  I mean, it's also geek-to-geek, but it's more \"official.\"  Users don't care -- they might have no idea what's even being discussed.\nHonestly, it's hard not to read this kind of thing as, \"We had a whole bunch of meetings where we debated what language\/technology\/platform to use.

Can you give me use cases or examples where a restaurant owner stands to make money from his site anywhere other than booking reservations possibly?","completion":"Websites are marketing. The most lucrative demographic for restaurants tends to be the 20s through 40s crowd, which is also the most likely to use the web to find and make a decision on a restaurant. Lowering the friction for finding out key information such as hours, location, menu, prices, etc. also lowers the friction for deciding to visit a restaurant, and that's dollars in the owners pocket."}

It's like some crazy countrywide delusion.\nBut it's not just your gun culture, it's something else. Who knows what part of the American psyche causes it. Perhaps it's the dark-side of the American dream. You have massive homicide rates compared to the rest of the stable developed world. When it comes to murder you're a backwards country.

Particularly noteworthy is the point that if a program sets an unusually high value on human life, it diverts resources from other programs also intended to protect human life, and thus brings about LESSENED protection of human life through that drain on resources. This provides thoughtful perspective on policy trade-offs. As Thomas Sowell has written, \"The first lesson of economics is scarcity: There is never enough of anything to satisfy all those who want it. The first lesson of politics is to disregard the first lesson of economics.\"","completion":"The most interesting aspect IMHO is that just about everybody would agree that this reasoning brought to its logical conclusion is immoral.\nFor example, a Space Shuttle launch costs on average $450 million, kills on average 0.1 astronauts and destroys 0.015 shuttles (worth $3 billion). If the Space Shuttle could be redesigned so that on average it cost $300 million to launch but killed two astronauts every time, predictably, would that be morally right?\nI would say no.

Seems to me if you are going to have the kids using computers, then typing should be an early skill to teach them as well.\nOn the flip side, I can see that for kids these days it must be much harder to learn to type. So much of their time is spent using computers, and so even spending an hour a day on touch-typing lessons is going to pale in comparison to the amount of time spent not touch typing because you don't know enough yet to touch type all the time.

It's nowhere near as cut and dry as they present it, you had the choice to never upload that data in the first place. It's not a safety deposit box where you own the contents, it's a online social site that you chose to use and provide some data in order to be able to use it.\nI've got no legal expertise, but that would be my first attempt as a devil's advocate."}

The general gist is that the government has terabytes of very interesting data and very limited resources for publicizing it.  The NYT knows this and they totally kill it by turning CSV files of population statistics into compelling, actionable presentations that tell a story.  You can do this, too.\nWith a little creativity, 1 GB of Bureau of Labor Statistics data becomes several hundred pages of rather interesting content for the client's niche.  Google doesn't particularly love raw data in terms of rankings, though, so the graphs got beefed up a bit with content written by TextBroker writers, stock photos, and the like.\nThe business goal is that eventually most of these pages will rank for, e.g., [computer science degree average salary], and that some portion of searchers will request an application packet through the website.  The CPA for that is between $10 and $100 (I'm not familiar with exactly how it is set).\nThis project took a few thousand dollars of outsourced work plus the equivalent of about three weeks of full time work from myself.  The client and I anticipate that it will be very successful for them.\nYou can do something fairly similar for your startup -- I've never seen one that can't combine engineering expertise plus writing to generate fairly compelling content at scale, and the SEO gains for it are considerable.  I recommend trying it.","completion":"One important factor that you missed is that where you study is also hugely important.

The money would then be used for capital repairs. The plan was bitterly opposed by residents who apparently value massively subsidized parking over non-falling-down buildings and\/or believe that the money is going to magically appear in some other way. DeBlasio has put out a modified version of the same plan, it involves a mix of \"affordable\" and market rate apartments being developed on the same parcels. That of course, will mean less money for NYCHA, which means fewer repairs, but I guess he doesn't care.\nPersonally, I think it makes the most sense to sell outright a few of the most valuable properties and use the money to make the necessary capital repairs on the rest of the system.

{"prompt":"GPS routing is awful compared to a person who knows their way around a city.\nUber drivers in hilly cities like San Francisco never, ever think to avoid climbing right up and down the steepest hills - the algorithms don't tell them not to, there's no traffic and it's not a low speed limit, it just sucks for other reasons.\nI had a driver last week who had never heard of Valencia St, and then misunderstood the GPS voice and accidently got on the freeway, getting us stuck in cross-bay traffic for 20 minutes just trying to get to the next exit. Of course I rated that ride 5 stars, because I'm not actually a psychopath ( http:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/jeffbercovici\/2014\/08\/14\/what-ar... )\nIt's going to be a long, long time before we put anything approaching the depth of information that years of experience brings into our algorithmic routing systems.

{"prompt":"An experience I had as a teenager really drove this lesson home for me, and is partly responsible for successes I\u2019ve had since.\nMy Dad had copy of \u2018Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain\u2019 by Betty Edwards lying around. I\u2019d always been really bad at drawing - never progressed beyond the kids-drawing phase, got bad feedback on drawing at school, so stopped.\nAnyway, Edwards\u2019s theory is that \u2018bad\u2019 drawers don\u2019t look at the thing itself and draw its shape, they translate reality into abstract concepts first and then draw what that concept visually looks like. So I\u2019ll look at a face, then decide I\u2019ll draw the \u2018eye\u2019 first, query my mind to see what an \u2018eye\u2019 looks like, then draw the generic 'eye' shape that everyone draws.\nWhereas a skilled artist looks at the eye in front of them - which looks nothing like the standard symbol for \u2018eye\u2019 - and draws THAT.\nEdwards has a bunch of exercises to prove this, and one of them triggered a massive epiphany for me.\nShe had a Picasso sketch in the book which was printed upside down on the page. Her instructions were to copy the drawing, keeping it upside down, and never naming the limb\/whatever you\u2019re drawing, and never turning your drawing right-side-up until it\u2019s complete.\nI was sceptical, but decided to test her theory. So I started copying this upside-down drawing, fully expecting it to turn out even worse than usual.\nWhen I finished, I couldn't believe it. The drawing was AMAZING. It looked like someone else had done it. The figure I\u2019d drawn looked alive.\nI went on to learn to draw pretty well. So after that, my mind always looked back and thought - well, if I can learn to DRAW, and I was so BAD at drawing initially, I can pretty much learn to do anything.","completion":"\n    ... well, if I can learn to DRAW, and I was so BAD \n    at drawing initially, I can pretty much learn to do \n    anything.\n\nI used to think like that.

{"prompt":"This is totally anecdotal, but isn't the US (especially at the college level) more focused on a \"broader\" education? My cousin got a BA in international relations in the US and then went and attended school in Spain. Something like only 1\/4 of his credits counted towards his degree there even though nearly all of them transferred. His explanation was that they expect less of a broad education and more specialization.\nRecalling my own experience I got a BA in political science and I spent something like 30 hours in my major, and 90+ in general education.\nIt seems as though many people on HN (and in general) talk about how we need more STEM majors, but then complain that a degree that's very highly technical isn't broad enough. If you want people to graduate in a reasonable amount of time than it almost has to be one or another.","completion":"After studying in both Spain and US, I can only say that this is correct (even though I did undergrad in Spain and grad studies in the US I think I have a pretty good idea of how the undergraduate studies work in the US).\nSpain has a (more) specialized system in the undergraduate studies, even though it has been shifted lately (with the much hated Bologna process) to a brad system. Prior to the instauration of the Bologna process, an undergraduate student in Spain had two options:\n- 1st cycle: 3 years of undergrad. I would say that it was pretty much equivalent to the undergrad in the US, but focusing only in courses relevant to the major.\n- 2nd cycle: 5 years of undergrad. This is (at least in STEM, the area I know) similar to a undergrad+master in the US (Even though in the US are only considered as a normal undergrad).\nIt depends on the university; some have a small number of credits that you can\/should spend on things separated from your major (even in some cases sports), other have nothing similar to that and 100% of the credits are relevant.\nCurrently the educational system in Spain is slightly different after trying to merge it with the rest of the educational systems in Europe. In most cases the change has been seen as a shift into an educational system where students are less prepared and have to pay a more expensive Master (after the undergrad) to receive the same education they received with an undergrad years ago."}
{"prompt":"Airbus pilot here. Electronic interference in take off and landing is real. It is pretty common and can indeed be pretty dangerous. The fact is that a tablet or smartphone in flight mode is not an issue as aren\u00b4t devices that are not transmitting.\nThe biggest problem (maybe the only one) is that when you approach the airport and reduce your speed and altitude, the cell phones begin to receive the signals from ground antennas and start trying to connect again with the maximum power(the airplane body dampens the signals), imagine this taking place with dozens of mobile phones at the same time. Also there is people who tries to call or send a message while in approach, making it worst.\nWhile on cruise there is no signal with modern 3g, also you go too fast to lock any tower so you don\u00b4t get the interferences. With old analog cell phones it was pretty usual to maintain signal and talk even at 30k feet (they affected flux sensor of the compass though).\nThis heavy transmission from tens of phones at the same time may or may not cause radio communication interferences (the same one you hear when your phone is close to the car radio annoying but not lethal), system computers reboots or complete loss of flight computers (and this can be very scary in bad weather, heavy traffic airport and close to the ground).\nThis has happened to me while in a landing in Paris, not something that I would recommend. Also a friend of mine had all the flight computers, alarms and lights going wild while trying to land at Madrid too. Usually is less dramatic than that, and only a computer or system resets, but you don\u00b4t know when or how you are going to face it and how bad will become.\nThe problem with flight modes is that a significant portion of passengers don\u00b4t know how to set it. Some of them don\u00b4t even know how to power off their phones, with the stewardess having do it  2 or 3 times each flight(improving lately, it seems people begin to know their devices).\nMaybe with an 3g antenna inside the plane, all the signals could be kept at low levels and this way be able to avoid interferences to the flight equipment.","completion":"Thanks for taking the time to comment here. I'm curious of this is such a widespread problem, presumably organizations like the FAA and researchers would have survey data from pilots that demonstrate how widespread the problem is (I would think pilots unions in particular would advocate for such information).

{"prompt":"First: you're missing all the users with less than 1000 reputation that have paid for CVs. There are actually about 1500 paid CVs in the system.\nIs there critical mass? I would say, in major tech\/development areas, or for national-footprint employers who relocated candidates, absolutely yes. A company like Google, Microsoft, Pixar will certainly find plenty of good candidates on Stack Overflow.\nIn smaller cities without big tech industries, and for people who don't want to relocate, mostly the answer is \"not yet\" although I expect to get there. The little startup in Tulsa that needs an embedded systems programmer but doesn't want to relocate someone... won't find them. The guy in Oklahoma City who won't move elsewhere isn't finding good tech jobs because there aren't any in Oklahoma City, not because we don't have critical mass.\nAs for the revenue, earning money was never the point of charging job seekers. We charge job seekers a minimal amount because it eliminates a huge number of unserious, unqualified, and other candidates who really don't stand a chance. If it's free, job seekers have an incentive to post their resume everywhere \"just in case\" which employers hate, because they have to filter through lots and lot of junk. We're actively looking for better ways to do this kind of pre-filtering. I'd like to lower the cost as much as possible without opening the floodgates, and I imagine we'll find creative ways to let high-rep stackoverflow users get a CV without paying very much. Nothing is set in stone.","completion":"I don't quite follow how charging money eliminates \"\u2026unqualified, and other candidates who really don't stand a chance\" from the selection pool.\nWhat does charging a fee have to do with qualification, and what other factor makes them not stand a chance (and which is also mitigated by charging a fee)?"}

{"prompt":"The comfort noise that he is referring to is the white noise that is intentionally introduced by modern digital cell phones. Most cell phones have a CODEC that will detect silence and rather than wasting valuable bandwidth on nothing, a silence packet is sent that says something like \"quiet for the next 250ms\" or something like that. The GSM specification for the AMR CODEC provides for a feature called comfort noise. It turns out that on the other end, if the listener hears total silence, they worry that the connection was lost.  So instead it will provide white noise, specifically +\/- 2048 (of a 16 bit word). Since a pseudo random number generator on the phone is typically used, it is making white noise, similar to the white noise you hear on an old fashioned analog phone or as the author references, a radio tuned to no station and you hear random static a percentage of which is cosmic MW background radiation from the  big bang.

My home country, Portugal, has destroyed its industry with a government-subsidized windmill scheme. 70% of your energy bill there is tax.","completion":"It also misses that fossil fuels enjoy massive government subsidies, some explicit (tax credits, etc.), and many implicit (not having to pay the massive costs of the pollution they generate). Yes, coal is really cheap, but one reason it's really cheap is because we allow people who burn it to pass on a huge proportion of the cost to the public at large.\nAny article discussing the cheapness of coal without mentioning the high hidden costs we pay in the form of pollution is really misleading."}

Did someone still there leak new information to him?","completion":"Very probably yes. GCHQ's retention goes back (very broadly) that far (it's inconsistent) - and they have some access to each other's networks (the NSA access GCHQ's network via example.gchq.nsa.ic.gov, specifically, so for example https:\/\/wiki.gchq.nsa.ic.gov\/index.php would get you to GCHQ's internal MediaWiki if you're on the NSA network - GCHQ use an internal .gchq TLD). They can query selectors on each other's databases, and filtering of what's \"not allowed\" seems to be very often up to the analyst. (Of course, I don't know if they share everything. Probably not.)\nThe NSA's own BLARNEY initiative for this stuff dates back to 1978, although I think GCHQ beat them to the punch in effective mass telephony intercept - the first one I'm aware of started in the early 1980s, although that is offline, and probably no longer archived as the media (digital tape with low-bitrate encoded audio) would probably have degraded beyond all usefulness by now (and it sounded pretty crunchy in the first place, I understand, kinda like a bad squelchy lower-side-band transmission!).\nRemember, however, that they didn't have the same kind of analysis capability back then that they've got these days (but they can probably go back and analyse old stuff they still retain). As Snowden's disclosed, you're seeing the newer systems having full-take ring buffers in nearline storage, followed by offline selection for recent access and analysis from that using a huge amount of distributed processing, and in turn automatic selected archiving out of that. It's pretty much the difference between microfiche and Google in effectiveness."}

{"prompt":"If you would like to do something significant within a months' time, learning C++ by reading a book is the worst possible course of action.\nStart by following along with some basic C++ tutorials.  Once you're comfy enough, start implementing your own small applications.  (Write a program to accept a sentence from the user and print it out.  Then write a function that takes two strings and returns true if the two strings are anagrams.  Keep thinking up small apps.)\nIt is my opinion that you must avoid learning STL and Boost if you want to be productive within a month.  Both libraries have enough quirks that it takes a significant amount of time and experience to use them correctly.  For example, you don't need the std::vector or std::list containers.  Simply allocate a sufficiently large array to hold your items, then allocate a larger array when the first one fills up.  A std::map container (a dictionary) is also not needed if you're tracking a small number of items.  Simply loop through all items until you find the one you're looking for.\nBasically, start actually writing code as quickly as possible.  If you feel like you're burning too much time trying to understand one tutorial, move on to another one.  But make sure at the end of each day that you can look back and say, \"I wrote a lot of apps today and I feel like I learned a lot.\"\nMost importantly, don't be afraid to throw your old code away once you have a better understanding of how best to solve the problem.  Implementing components as quickly as possible is the key to productivity.  Rewriting your old code is the key to not making a mess.\nContact me at palish@gmail.com if you have any questions along the way.  I'd be happy to help.  I'm a self-taught graphics programmer, so I can relate to how scary C++ can seem at first.

{"prompt":"Let's put aside the Federal Government (and taxes and spending) for a moment and focus on the Federal Reserve.\nThe Federal Reserve printed a large amount of money in response to the crisis.  (That was a silent tax on anyone holding cash.)  To inject this money into the economy, they bought a bunch of securities.  My question is simply: why use asset buying as a vehicle for injecting money into the economy and not cash to citizens?  Cash to citizens seems more fair than picking winners and losers and propping up assets that would otherwise be worth much less.  It seems the Federal Reserve's strategy of the past 5 years has done very little to reboot the economy, and has worsened wealth inequality dramatically.","completion":"Part of the reason for the purchase of securities was to lower the interest rate on longer term securities like the 10 year treasury note. This lowered the rate a lot of consumer loans like mortgages, car loans, etc. with the hope of stimulating the economy. Usually the Federal Reserve just changes the discount rate (overnight rate to banks) to try and stimulate the economy but lowering the discount rate through 2007 and 2008 wasn't lowering the longer term interest rates and thus consumer borrowing rates. Thus Bernanke took the unprecedented step of buying the securities to drive down the longer term interest rates as well.\nIn effect they printed money to do this but inflation remained quite low by standard measures. Bernanke requested Congress to help stimulate the economy in the near term, but politically it was impossible for Congress to achieve even a short term second stimulus package. History will be the final judge of the extraordinary actions taken by the Federal Reserve but to me it seemed like the best of a lot of bad options. Even as I'm glad that some agency was trying to stimulate the economy I'm concerned about the historical precedent that a small unelected group can decide to take on so much debt with no public comment."}

{"prompt":"This is why we can't have nice things.\nI don't know much about Minecraft or whatever issue Notch is referring to in his post.  But I'm always struck by how quickly people snap to emotional argument and response, without thinking about the other side of the question, without thinking about how their response will be read or felt by others.\nThe first step in any dialogue is trying to understand why the other side has said or done what they have, and how that might seem reasonable and right to them.  Without that, how do we have any hope of learning anything, or moving to any actual agreement?  And yet 98% of what I read presumes that any disagreement must be ignorant, stupid or evil.\nI understand many of the reasons why people talk this way, and yes, it's hard to avoid it.  But we now have more communication amongst ourselves than at any other time in human history.  Maybe it's time to start thinking hard about how each of us can communicate better.\nWouldn't it be great if we could get to a community where some idiosyncratic dude could write a monster hit without feeling himself battered for reasons he can't understand?","completion":"> This is why we can't have nice things.\nThis is a nice thing.\nNotch gets the resources and freedom to do what he actually wants to be doing: Exploring and experimenting with game ideas.

{"prompt":"I was a little surprised that the legality of this was questioned, so looked it up. In Roman Law tradition this kind of action would apparently be called \"periculum in mora\". An example would be that you enter another person's apartment without consent, because you noticed a strong smell of gas on the other side of the door.\nThe OP in the linked article had strong reasons to believe that the people who submitted their credit card data were in imminent danger of large financial damages if he did not stop the fraud quickly.\nApparently (and to my surprise), in the US the idea of \"periculum in mora\" only applies to law enforcement agents (http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Exigent_circumstance_in_United_...), though.

{"prompt":"Massachusetts is already hostile to noncompete agreements; they have a \"blue pencil\" standard that allows judges to rewrite noncompetes instead of requiring the original agreement to be enforced verbatim, and noncompetes in MA have to be specific to the work the employee was doing.\nLike I said last time when this subject came up, consider whether this development is a great thing; there's unlikely to be a federal ban on noncompetes, which means other jurisdictions may be nominally more attractive for sales and knowledge businesses because they're legally favorable to business owners.","completion":"California has banned non-competes for a while now, and I have yet to see any numbers indicating a mass migration of employers."}

{"prompt":"I like the Ubuntu Linux distributions not just because of the \"lock in\" issues,  but a lot of things \"just work\" with Ubuntu that are difficult with Red Hat.\nFor instance there is a Sun Java installer that \"just works\" with Ubuntu and will keep your Sun Java up to date when you do your system updates.  If you need a Bit Torrent client you can just\napt-get install transmission\nbut it turns out to be quite an exercise to compile and install any Bit Torrent client for Red Hat Linux.\nI remember how Solaris was the center of the open source world in 1991,  but by 2001 it was starting to get hard to compile things on Solaris.  Red Hat is also diverging from the open source mainstream and it is \"just hard\" to do things that \"just work\" with Ubuntu.","completion":"Red Hat is made to use Red Hat repos.

{"prompt":"SOX hasn't killed the IPO, it's just made the hurdle higher and that's ok. IPOs are about consistent revenue generation - most of the firms of Web 1.0 didn't have it and didn't deserve to IPO.\nWrong, wrong, and wrong.\n1. SOX has killed the IPO; IPOs have plummeted since SOX, due to the ridiculously draconian laws that make compliance expensive and time-consuming.  Startups and small companies just can't afford the costs, closing one of the two viable exits for founders and investors.\n2. \"Raising the bar\" for IPOs makes it sound like we're just going to get higher quality.  The reality is that most companies can't afford to IPO, and even if they can, they're now hampered by greater costs and the distractions of compliance.  If the bar needs to be raised, let the market raise it.\n3. IPOs are not about consistent revenue generation: they're about raising capital.  There's absolutely no reason why a growth business like Facebook that is not profitable shouldn't be able to IPO.  If the market likes their odds of succeeding in the long run, their IPO will be a success.  If not, it won't.  In your model, someone apparently gets to decide who \"deserves\" to IPO.  This kind of thing has never worked and almost always has the opposite effect of that desired.","completion":"1) I dug up the following table - it doesn't appear that SOX killed the IPO. There were over 150 IPOs each year from 2004-2007:\nhttp:\/\/bear.cba.ufl.edu\/ritter\/IPOs2008VC.pdf\n(The question is what the heck is going on in 2008?)\n2) Yes, we are getting better quality.  If you were around for the fluff IPOs of the late 90s you'd agree. For every Kana Communications there were at least 9 other immature flops like pets.com, etoys.com, flooz.com that died within 3 years.\n3) Companies get to choose their own destiny.  If they're ready to IPO they'll swallow the $5million overhead of SOX and head out to the market.  Those that can't swallow the cost or time will either have to wait or find alternate means.\nThat said, SOX is still a beast born of a knee-jerk reaction and I'd love to see it streamlined.  But there's some good in there."}
{"prompt":"There are (at least) three valid perspectives on the patent situation within the software community but part of the reason so little constructive progress is made is that many people with strong opinions will often flat-out deny or reject the validity of the other perspectives because it is outside their experience.\nThree perspectives of which most people ignore one or more:\n- Computer technology is over-run with frivolous, vague, stupid, conflicting, and contradictory patents. Any pretense of quality control by the USPTO was lost in the 1990s. This imposes a non-trivial cost on the entire ecosystem and a complete absence of quality control is arguably worse than no patents at all.\n- R&D into new computer algorithms is a non-trivial investment, frequently requiring years and millions of dollars. There is a tendency among programmers to discount the level of effort required to develop a new computer algorithm that materially extends the state-of-the-art even though most could not develop such algorithms themselves and have never been involved in such R&D. Organizations that make this investment do so looking for a return.\n- Academia is already facing difficulties in computer science because much of the state-of-the-art research is being done by private companies. Much of this research is being treated as trade secrets because (ironically) patents offer flimsy practical protection. As a consequence, there are a number of areas in computer science where the leading academic papers are literally a good half decade behind the state-of-the-art that is buried in NDAs. Lack of publication means that a lot of smart people are wasting time duplicating work. Patents were originally invented precisely to avoid this outcome. One of the reasons that I stopped reading academic computer science in some areas that interest me is that I see computer science under NDA that is much more sophisticated, which is a shame.\nAny practical policy will need to take into consideration all of these perspectives. It is not as convenient and simple as \"all software patents are evil!\" or \"software patents FTW!\" but it more closely reflects the real tradeoffs.","completion":"I'm interested in a reply to iskander's question as well as some concrete examples of new \"computer algorithms... frequently requiring years and millions of dollars\"."}
{"prompt":"I have flown a lot (IE: 100K+ miles\/year) at various points in my career, and I'm disappointed by the commentary here about flight attendants. Think for a moment about their job - every day they are interacting with hundreds of people, assessing which ones might be a problem and trying to deal with each personality type with a smile, all while balancing (often in high heels) your drink at 30,000 feet in a vehicle traveling hundreds of miles per hour AND to add insult to injury, doing so on little sleep and for very little pay. Give 'em a break, eh?\nSeparate from that, even as a frequent flyer, I'd rather people not have their attention stuck in their iDevice during takeoff and landing. Those are the times when a problem on the aircraft is most likely to materialize, and I'd rather not lose my ass in an accident because your attention was on Angry Birds. Further, in those minutes at the beginning of a flight if you are fooling around with your phone\/kindle\/etc and blocking the isle, you delay expedient loading and unloading of the aircraft. I've had colleagues busy on their [device] say things like \"but, but I was just wrapping up a call, why was the flight attendant so rude!\" No asshole, you were blocking the plane from loading \/ unloading. Think of others for a whopping ten minutes and put down the device so we can all safely load \/ unload and get on\/off the ground.","completion":"Couldn't agree more.\nI used to fly a lot (family overseas, so accumulated a couple of million miles over the years). It never, ever, bothered me to turn off devices for 10-15 minutes. Quite the opposite. I always enjoyed the moment to pause my hyper-connected life and put my gadget addiction in perspective.\nMy most disgusting experience was with an a-hole sitting next row, impatiently speaking on the phone when we were landing. At the very last second the pilot noticed the runway wasn't clear -- there was a parked vehicle in the middle, and had to do a subtle maneuver and get the plane back on air. We had some very tense 30 seconds.\nOf course the phone call had nothing to do with the error by the air traffic control, but any sort of electromagnetic interference at that precise moment could have killed us all.\nPeople frequently ask FAA why we should turn devices off. I still think the correct question is why not?"}

According to my research, skateboards are considered \"play\" devices. Whereas bikes and all motorized vehicles are required to be in the street, skateboarders under 14 must wear a helmet and are not allowed to ride in the street. Older skateboarders have the option, but not the requirement to ride in the street.

Yes, Macs are incredibly popular with developers.\n1) The reason I have always liked Macs since I was a kid is they basically come with what they need, and its easy to install extra stuff if you need it. Just because many developers like Macs doesn't mean that most Mac owners are developers.

There's absolutely no need to include gcc or the other dev tools by default. Non-developer folks almost never open the Terminal, much less compile their own software.\n3) At most, I have to download the latest version of Xcode every 4-6 months. Yeah, she's a fat beast of a .dmg, but downloading and installing doesn't take up more than a few hours a year.

It's actually substantially harder to avoid that lazy loading functionality than it is to take advantage of it.\nObviously, the systems used to lazily load machine code stored locally are different from what would be needed to modularize and lazily load source code being loaded over the network, but surely there's some way to improve this without making programmers do a ton of grunt work. If pages are loading huge amounts of JavaScript code that goes unused simply because it's easier to code that way, doesn't that mean the tools are deficient?"}
{"prompt":"Yes. But. (and this post doesn't intend to argue Aaron was depressed, just thinks about the premise that he might have been)\nAs someone who suffers a lot with depression, it is quite possible to be depressed and for no one close to you to notice. We can be damn good at hiding it, especially with practice, especially with people we know well.\nSome time ago I was living with my partner and she had no clue I had been depressed for months. Then we went out with a couple we hadn't seen for a little while, and afterwards the  girl took my partner aside and asked if I was OK.\nTaren obviously knows him best, and I agree that if she says Aaron wouldn't have committed suicide if it weren't for the case then clearly that is true. However, I think she is dismissing the impact of depression, or at least dismissing the possibility, to readily. You could turn around and suggest that if he hadn't been in depression (if indeed he was) then the case may have not driven him to suicide.\nDepression is a horrible, and terrible thing. Those close to depressed individuals certainly have a lot of insight, but it is still nearly impossible to communicate what it is like even to them.\nEDIT: I'm cautious to add this, because it is \"one guy on the internet\", but reading Taren's post again some of the things she describes strike me as telltale signs of secreted depression. Disappearing on a whim for a hike, for example, is a favourite of mine.\nEDIT2: It is also worth noting she describes one common set of symptoms of depression (low activity, disinterest, etc.). However, I for one don't often get them (for example) but I do become deeply involved in subjects for periods of time before moving on. Similar to how she describes. This is a very very common symptom of depression and if you see a friend become obsessed with a string of new things take a second to think about how they might be.","completion":"Thanks for these thoughts.

The trend seems very much in the opposite direction, towards standardization and reliance on a few very carefully designed curves (optimized for performance on modern CPUs, and to avoid implementation pitfalls that give rise to vulnerabilities with older curves).\nIn fact, drawing any kind of conclusion about the diversity of fields in use seems a little strange.

{"prompt":"Some people here seem to think that this is temporary, that sometime in the future Bitcoin will stabilize into a glorious future global currency -- never mind the new class of cryptobarons it will have created from its inner circle, through shameless hoarding.\nMy question is, what then will happen when Bitcoin stabilizes, that is, when the time to new coin mined approaches practically infinity? Let's assume the global economy grows at 4% per year. Do Bitcoin's proponents believe a constant 4% deflation rate will be somehow compatible with capitalism? Why lend, why build new companies, when simply storing it is more than enough? Take shocks such as bubbles and demand-side crises. Could a economy based on Bitcoin survive them, and not crash inevitably into a deflationary spiral? I claim it won't.\nThe party line usually argues for the evils of inflation. What they don't understand, I think, is that capitalism, in its revolutionary (in the sense of production) facet, needs inflation, feeds from it. Inflation might screw lenders, and favor debtors, sure. But deflation is just the inverse: a gift for the leecherous rentier class, and a massive \"fuck you\" to entrepreneurs.","completion":"You are espousing one form of economics which many consider unsustainable.\nRegardless, many assets are deflationary.

Telling people they should submit to inflation for the greater good is ridiculous. Inflation works because it keeps those too poor to have real assets on the gerbil wheel. The wealthy (or smart) just store their money in non-inflationary assets and sit pretty.\nBesides, if you can't get better than a 4% return, you probably shouldn't be investing in whatever it is you're considering anyhow."}

So, those kinds of businesses have much more of an incentive to use legislation to restrict entry, rather than relying on more \"inherent\" economic barriers.  Relatively speaking, they have a higher payoff to lobbying than, say, a pizzeria that needs to invest a lot in ovens, rent, and payroll - if you can afford those, you can afford to either take Pizza Making 101 under a licensing regime, or more realistically fight the licensing regime itself.\nHow do you change that pattern given a democracy that responds to lobbying?

In fact, by far the majority of the worlds population lives south of the 33rd parallel north.\nThirdly, where I live (Australia) one of the major causes of death is cancer, specifically skin cancer.

{"prompt":"Figure out what sort of looks and cultural qualities you like in a wife\/girlfriend. Travel to that country and live there for a couple months staying in hostels or couch surfing. Meet girls. Extend the 2 months as long as needed, switching countries if there are issues. Marry foreign girl. Stay in her country where you now have a spouse visa.

I want out.\" and you also said you didn't have any ideas for new products or interest in starting your own company. So move to a place where everything is different and that should be sufficient challenge to keep you interested in life. Bureaucracy might be the same, but it's going to be a different kind of bureaucracy.\nI also strongly recommend you find a girl with the exact opposite personality as you. If you are introverted, she should be extroverted. If you are analytical and cautious, she should be free spirited. There are actually studies that have shown the exact opposite Myers-Briggs personality type is an ideal match since you'll complement each other very well as a unit, creating a balanced unit facing the world. So if you are a INTJ programmer she should be a ESFP party girl. You might say gosh but we have nothing in common, I can't relate to her way of thinking at all.

Exercising common sense is generally a good thing to do anywhere you go, but the things you talk about occur around the world and aren't just limited to states with a majority muslim population.\n> The reason turkey, morocco etc are better behaved are because they're dependent on EU for economic support.\nIt's clear you've never been to Turkey. Turkey's outpaced the EU for economic growth for years and effectively dodged an economic bullet by not joining the EU. It may benefit by not being in the Euro, but loses out on tariffs and taxes. If you walk around Levent in Istanbul you'll see the real money's coming from China, Russia and the Middle East, not Europe.","completion":"You are right about the shift in Turkey's trade to the middle east. Turkey still exports something like 25% - 40% of its total exports to EU countries (not sure about exact % right now). If the EU imposed trade sanctions on Turkey, it would be hard to argue that there would be no effect.\nHow can you even compare holocaust denial laws to what muslim countries do? You think denying people the right to disagree with the state or condemning them to a life with their rapist or torturing a man AND taking away the right of people to deny a historical fact are the same thing? I don't see why the holocaust denial law is necessary but I don't see it as being oppressive to rights that should be fundamental!\nReligious headscarves should be banned for the same reason slavery is. Just because a slave would never complain to law enforcement agencies and does not see the injustice in his life because he has been brainwashed and accepts his fate does not mean the state should not enforce his rights.

{"prompt":"Heidegger posited that our society's anxiety over death was artificial. Not the instinctive fear of death, but the constant worrying. This also leads to massive denial of the reality of death in popular culture (at least your own death; death is something that happens to \"other people\"). He proposed that people would be happier if they stopped denying their own mortality and also stopped being afraid of it.\nSo maybe the LSD and psilocybin just cut through the socialized anxiety crap and give people a more natural or normal view of death, among other things.","completion":"You can reach the same insight by doing enough vipassana meditation. I've talked with people who, having gained this insight through LSD, psilocybin, or other methods, gain an interest in meditation.\nEither way, it's not so much that it cuts through socialized anxiety. Another insight you gain from this kind of experience is realizing how much you participated in creating the socialized anxiety within you. The anxiety doesn't go away so much as you become less attached to it. Being less attached to it, you see how it no longer serves a purpose in your life, and you're free to pay attention to the stuff that is more important. Like experiencing what time you have left -- and make no mistake, whether you have a terminal cancer, or not (or whether we make it to technology that allows someone to transfer personality into silicon), you too will eventually die.\nOne day, I hope that we'll have socially sanctioned initiations, not just for treating existential anxiety in people facing terminal illness. It would cut away a lot of teenage adolescent bullshit, and a lot of midlife bullshit. Having experienced that \"cosmic force\" invites people to really connect with each other, something far more meaningful than our current crop of \"social networks.\" So this isn't just about having a meaningful experience of death.

{"prompt":"There's a reason for this phenomenon. It might be misguided in this particular case, but there is a reason that it exists. It's the same reason that everyone here loves businesses based on technology. It's the same reason that VCs are willing to invest millions of dollars in nascent companies which will, in all likelihood, fail in the near future. It's the same reason I spend my evenings working on my own startup.\nThe reason is scalability.\nMy dad was always shocked that investors valued the last startup I worked for in the tens of millions of dollars while we were losing money. He's worked in construction his whole life for firms that do on the order of $100MM in revenue per year. Like all construction firms, however, their margins are razor thin. Their revenue doesn't grow much faster than their costs (employees and materials, primarily).\nA construction company that loses money is not going to be worth $50MM any time soon. A tech company with similar financials might be. A tech company might take a while to get their technology right. But when they do, they can leverage it. Their revenues can grow far faster than their costs. Software as a product scales better than just about anything I can think of. Software businesses often go from slightly in the red to huge annual profits in very little time.\nEveryone in tech is trying to find the Next Big Thing. This includes us (entrepreneurs), the media, and investors. In the case of the media, they're just trying to be the first ones to break the next big story, as usual. Just like investors, if they want to succeed, they have to be willing to take risks. They have to bet on companies that look like they have potential. Sometimes they're wrong. But in those rare cases where it pays off, it usually pays off big.\nOther industries lack this quality. In other industries 1 success is not going to make up for 10 failures.

So he had them sell it off. He did a lot of cigar butts like that. Back then, Buffett was pretty pushy. He would do whatever it took to acquire all the stock of companies and would sack the management teams and replace them with others. At one point an entire town in Dempster protested against him.\nThen he met Charlie Munger and Munger got him to start focusing on acquiring good businesses that had franchise values. See's Candy is the best example. So he looked for companies with sustainable competitive advantages and high returns on invested capital. So he started to buy your good businesses run by great entrepreneurs with little actual control. The only thing he would ask is if they could not meet an internal hurdle for ROIC (return on invested capital) that they give excess capital for him to redeploy.\nNow, if you look at what Buffett has been doing, he's continued to evolve a bit. He seems much more focused on buying utility-like businesses. MidAmerican and Burlington Northern exemplify this. They don't throw off cash that can be redeployed elsewhere like the previous Berkshire deals. At the same time though, they potentially can be around for the next 50 years and increase prices to make up for inflation.\nThese deals are probably going to continue.

No one - not a single person as far as I can tell - in the community calls them \"drones\" because it is an ugly word and it's associated with machines that fly to pakistan and murder people. Everyone - every single person - outside the UAV community does call them drones. I see no solution to this except for the fact that if you're a part of that community and you meet someone else who is, and you call it a UAV or multirotor, they know you're \"in\" which is sort of cool I guess ;-)","completion":"I have found that to the general public, drone now means either of two distinct things:\n1. Any type of multirotor, regardless of how autonomous it is or whether it has a camera transmitting video\n2. An autonomous fixed wing military aircraft used to take grainy green videos and drop bombs\nAlthough, actually, the second option would more likely not be the default, and called a \"military drone\" to clarify."}

{"prompt":"The only problem I have with this, is that for a really simple system consisting of 3 components (web+app+db) now I need to deploy (and pay for!!) 24 components.\nYes I know, business continuity and stuff. Still, just doesn't feel right somehow.","completion":"You have options. You can pay for and run just three components on AWS, and still have the power of dynamically scaling your application when you need to.\nYou can then pay for three really cheap VPS's and load balancers around the world using something like Linode (or a much less reliable VPS, doesn't really matter) and replicate your data occasionally to the VPS. When your AWS instance goes down (because you foolishly rely on the same Virginia datacenter that has more breakdowns than Lindsay Lohan) you cut over to the hot spare VPS and rate-limit your incoming requests until AWS comes back.\nYou end up paying for 6(ish) services, still relying mostly upon AWS but with a tiny DR site you can use during emergencies."}
{"prompt":"Uh.... that's not how math works.\nWhat you mean to say is \"The Globe sold for $70 million, but if you think about the pension obligations, the buyer is really paying about $180 million for it.\" which is very different from the \"sold for -$40 million\", which isn't even a thing that makes sense.","completion":"I disagree, the math makes sense to me. Seller kept pension obligations, buyer didn't take them on."}
{"prompt":"I love how the writer phrased Google's incentive for investing as \"Google has a practical goal in linking up with SpaceX.

{"prompt":"I can't count how many companies I've seen post jobs in the past month that use this bromide. It's getting a bit timeworn now. Do these companies really feel that using this phrase improves the quality of their hires?","completion":"I think it's become a typical part of the corporate mantra to repeat it; possibly it snuck in via recruiters in the same way as \"dynamic\" and \"passionate\". I'm not sure that they really feel that it increases the quality of hires so much as it being something that they feel they have to do."}
{"prompt":"Go succeeds because Google's behind it.\nGo certainly doesn't succeed because of smug\/boring articles like this one. The potshot at Erlang early on (also cf. slurs on Rust and Haskell in some of these comments) betrays the same old \"we like it here in our cave\" bias of Go boosters whenever confronted with its glaring warts.\nGo is a great choice for certain workloads, is reasonably fun to code in, and has great doc support on the web. I suspect however it's popular also because it isn't FP and doesn't favor immutability. It plays well with the haters who refuse to understand how good GC\/list fusion\/stronger types\/better abstraction can make code easier to understand and way faster.\nBut the bottom line is no Google, no Go. Just like no Sun, no Java. It's simply unbeatable to have a mega tech corp paying folks to write docs libs and patches. But it doesn't save it from being yet another turing tarpit.","completion":"Yep, just like Dart... oh, wait."}
{"prompt":"Is this a \"lost art\"? I always consider the layout when I'm writing a C struct. It's the principal concern that governs the correct ordering of the members.","completion":"His definition of \"lost art\" can be summed up as \"can't be Googled\". I think that is fair, at least when it come to programming."}
{"prompt":"One of the solutions in the comments I found quite pythonic and concise. Somehow people have it in their heads that \"Pythonic\" means long-winded. And yes, you have to read the code and think for a second to understand it, but that's no crime.\n  [(not x % 3) * 'Fizz' + (not x % 5) * 'Buzz' or x for x in range(1, 101)]","completion":"I like the solution, but I usually keep \"The Zen of Python\" in mind when writing 'Pythonic' code."}
{"prompt":"well, is it better to have a hacked MVP released in production, or spend forever making it and never actually releasing it and then missing the window?","completion":"Depends on what the product itself is and from which perspective you're asking the question. At any rate, those are almost never the only two choices..."}
{"prompt":"The first example, \"unbiased standard deviation\" is mislabeled.  The estimator of the variance is unbiased but the square root of an unbiased estimator is not itself unbiased.

{"prompt":"How do we reconcile the part of humanity pushing advancement towards understanding the universe and creating entirely new paradigms every six months while half the world is still monkeys with sticks (and the monkeys inevitably get advanced technologies without the wisdom or maturity required to use it responsibly)?","completion":"Start by leaving the word \"monkey\" out of any discussion involving African people."}
{"prompt":"These horror stories are so common that I have to ask: why does anyone still use PayPal?\nI ask this in the most constructive way possible... is there a set of use-cases that PayPal is still the best for? Is it a lack of awareness of alternatives? International availability? Something else?","completion":"Mainly international payments. Plus, customers are more likely to already have an account with them, and no one feels like signing up for a new payment system just to buy something at your store."}
{"prompt":"I have a hard time believing I could start smoking 1 cigarette per an hour if I stood at my desk instead of sat, and the bad (smoking) would be balanced out with the good (standing)?\nIs sitting really that bad? Or is smoking really not that bad?","completion":"On the one hand, isn't that bad. People have survived 50+ years of smoking multiple cigarettes a day (some of them will have smoked 200,000+ cigarettes)\nOn the other hand, smoking not only shortens your life, it also makes (part of it) less enjoyable. Statistically, smokers are ill more often and get chronic health problems earlier.\nAlso, I bet the 'sitting is bad' meme will see some nuance added to it in due time. Even ignoring that, this message talks of sitting for two hours, without break. That, IMO, is very rare. Lunch, coffee, toilet breaks?"}
{"prompt":"Do people really pigeon-hole themselves into being just back-end engineers? Or just front-end?  I can imagine a designer-type person picking up HTML, CSS, and eventually JavaScript and calling him\/herself a front-end engineer in a limited way.  But as a programmer I work on all of it, both server-side and client-side portions. (So I'm a full-stack engineer I guess.)\nIt seems to me that a designer who picked up some JavaScript would still not be a programmer. Lots of apps require advanced JavaScript to run a UI client-side. I would not expect anyone who was a full programmer to be just a front-end engineer and be completely unwilling to learn PHP or Ruby to also work on the back-end.  If I met a person like that I would think the person a horrible programmer and not hire him\/her. (Unable or unwilling to learn, lack of passion for software engineering excellence.)  A designer with a few extra skills is one thing, but a restricted programmer is something else entirely.\nBut what do I know? Hence I ask whether this is common.","completion":"It depends on the employer but I find it quite common. Non-technical hiring managers might see a full-stack developer as a both a backend and frontend developer and it seems very attractive. Top tier employers usually want the best of the best and can afford to have multiple members on a team and thus allow that specialization.\nIf you specialize in a certain skillset, focusing on that skillset gives you time to be even better. Sure, there's developers that can write both back-end and front-end code but they've given up a level of specialization in order to do that. It's not a reluctance to learn but a different focus of what to learn. It has nothing to do with passion.\nMost full-stack developers I've met are really backend developers that can also write some front-end code. They don't spend the time to learn all the intricacies of CSS\/HTML or stay up to date with changes in spec \/ new tools and methodologies. I don't know you at all so I can only guess but if you think about it, do you find yourself better at either the frontend or the backend? It's very rare for someone to be a top 10% backend developer and a top 10% frontend developer. I could call myself a full-stack developer because I'm capable of writing both portions of an application but I know that I don't write one end as efficiently or securely as a specialist."}
{"prompt":"I hate how you americans kicked South Africa for the same things they stopped to do, like, just fifteen years earlier.\nThat's like punching other people instead of saying \"sorry, I did bad things\". Bonus thing, you ruin a country in process.","completion":"At risk of speaking for others, I don't think most Americans feel a cohesive group identity as an 'American' or as a white American. Does it make much sense to generalize \"you South Africans\" including both Afrikaners and Bantus?"}
{"prompt":"I'm not sure what is worse:\n- the fact that this is technically possible,\n- the fact that the software and service providers think it is appropriate to offer the feature,\n- the fact that some employers (such as the one in the article) actually think it is even slightly reasonable behaviour to use the feature on someone's personal phone,\n- the fact that the wiping behaviour isn't already clearly illegal with horrific penalties, or\n- the idea that the kind of employee waiver mentioned in the article might actually be considered a fair and enforceable part of any employment contract.\nThis is just so completely wrong, it's hard to know where to start!","completion":"This is just so completely wrong, it's hard to know where to start!\nYou could start by not being a panicky reactionary mess about it.\nIt is useful to be able to wipe a remote mobile device with access into a company computer system when it it is lost, compromised or in unfriendly hands.\nFrom that follows that software developers made it possible and providers made it available and employers think it reasonable to use on any mobile device which agreed to access their servers, personal or not.\nIt isn't illegal with \"horrific penalties\" - why would it be?"}

No one is ever going to give me anything, so I just have to suck it up and get it for myself.\nIf OP perseveres for what he wants as well as he whines, problem solved.\nOh and by the way, I got my MBA and worked at Denny's in 1978, so STFU and get busy.","completion":"People who are really serious at work, get into jobs in the last year of uni or before. There are loads of programs at uni, that you can get involved in, to help businesses. Some of these even pay, i did one that involved stochastic modelling for a large car company.

{"prompt":"I sense a backlash growing. It seems like the only time people take you seriously these days is if you're in your 20's, have a spiky-haired asian dude as one of your founders and are launching a social\/mobile\/streaming video app in a weekend.

{"prompt":"I've often wondered how most people read comments. There's something funny you see in voting patterns if you make a comment, and then someone replies with refutation, and then the refutation is refuted, and so on.\nFist, you see your comment get upvoted. But, if someone replies with a refutation that uses the word because[1], or is otherwise convincing, and calls you an idiot, you'll start to get downvoted (downvotes are rarer if there's no invective). That happens even if the 'refutation' consists purely of blatant logical fallacies. I tend not to reply to those, because it seems like a waste of time, so I'll often get downvoted to or below 0 before someone replies to the reply, at which point my comment score will start climbing upwards again.\nThis is the only site I regularly comment on, because I don't know of any public forum that has a similarly high level of discussion. I'm not sure the level of reading is the same, though. Skimming is dangerous. I do it, too, unfortunately.\nThere's actually been a set of studies that have shown that people are more likely to be convinced by nonsense they've read if they're distracted. The dangerous part here is that once you've been convinced by something, you don't tag that information as being unreliable because you didn't think critically about it when you first saw it. I'll sometimes catch myself, in a friendly debate, repeating something I've read, and then immediately saying \"nevermind; that doesn't make any sense\", because I'd absorbed the information unconsciously without thinking about it, but the act of saying it reveals that it's not logically sound.\n[1] http:\/\/bps-research-digest.blogspot.com\/2009\/01\/would-you-gi...","completion":"I'll sometimes catch myself, in a friendly debate, repeating something I've read, and then immediately saying \"nevermind; that doesn't make any sense\"\nI'm nearly 40 and I find I'm still \"defragging\" my childhood.

{"prompt":"This currently isn't \"news,\" as the paper hasn't been published yet, and none of the disclosed findings are too damning or conclusive.\nThat being said, it's important for two reasons:\n1.) the paper gets published tomorrow, which will lead to a round of negative press, regardless of the claims' merit.\n2.) More significant: it highlights what I see as an existential threat to the Bitcoin experiment: a.) the poor distribution of early wealth and b.) the possibility that a great percentage of all Bitcoins are currently held by bad actors (criminals, anarchists, use your imagination).\nA few things to consider:\n1. A list of richest Bitcoin addresses is not a good representation of the concentration of wealth. A single person can have x wallets, just like this Ulbricht character.\n2. Bitcoin wealth is often used to reinvest in mining equipment, which furthers one's wealth to a greater extent.

I'm not referring to what said person could purchase with that wealth, but one's ability to manipulate markets.\nThis has never been a big issue, as far as the growth in value of the currency.  However, I think this kind of uncertainty could freak out potential institutional investors.\nAltcoins like Litecoin, PPC, Namecoin, etc - do not suffer as much from this issue because their exposure was far greater than Bitcoin ca. 2009, and the mining competition was greater on the respective debut-dates by several orders of magnitude.","completion":"An uneven distribution of early wealth describes almost every organisation in society (including society itself): as long as later participants perceive they are gaining value for themselves, they will allow this to continue.\nPart (b) is more interesting - the danger as I see it is that Bitcoin is entering legal-issues territory. For example, a legal crackdown on ownership of Bitcoin identified with illegal activity would likely provide an economic shock to the whole network."}

She's not asking for it, but she is making herself a public figure and they are usually targets of such behaviour.\nI'd hope that the women I work with aren't regularly getting rape threats from my co-workers...\n> I\u2019ve personally never heard of a man in the games industry getting rape threats for having an opinion.\nBecause men are not women, and women are not men, it goes a little something like this: rape is an act of power (not sexual satisfaction). The threat of rape is the threat of asserting power over someone else. When these lowlifes are offended by a woman, they respond with the animal instinct of threatening to overpower them and rape is the closely available tool. None of them would actually ever have the guts to rape, I'm sure.\nWhen men have contrarian opinions, rape is not threatened, but a whole chain of events occurs, the purpose of which is to remove as much power as possible from that man.\nConsider famous causes that you know of where men who are not independently wealthy and have voiced opinions that are controversial to some. What happened to them? They were fired, demoted, jailed, investigated etc. The PyCon case some time back comes to mind.\nConsider famous cases of women who did the same. What happened to them? Threats of rape. The same woman involved in the PyCon case, I'll bet, received rape threats. Additionally, she did get fired because she was a public spokesperson for her company.\nThese threats are about asserting power over dissenting viewpoints in a bid to make yours dominant. You perhaps won't outright hear of a man getting threatened with rape, except maybe in prison or during a competitive game, but you will definitely hear of men being hurt in different ways for having opinions that make people uncomfortable.","completion":"Obviously you get more threads if you're a writer or even a journalist.

{"prompt":"Greetings from a speaker of a linguistic oddity that doesn't have a universal form of the word \"you\".\nMy native language -- Sinhalese -- has two forms: written and spoken. The written form, which has a grammar very similar to Latin, does have a universal \"you\", but the spoken form, which is largely grammer-less except for tense, does not. You literally cannot address someone without knowing their status\/relationship to you. This leads to some difficult and sometimes hilarious situations:\n- Children, family members and lovers are often addressed \"oya\". Using this on your boss or teacher could lead to problems. More acceptable when used by women and girls than by men.\n- There's no way to informally address a superior without a salutation or a name. This leads to people repeatedly using a person's name or salutation in the same sentence. E.g. \"Sir, should I have that report sir asked for on sir's desk before sir leaves for sir's doctor's appointment?\"\n- Some old fashioned couples have entire conversations (and sometimes marriages) without using second person pronouns because they don't have a single version they feel comfortable with.\n- Male friends of roughly equal age tend to call each other \"machang\" -- a term that is well known to those who have known Sri Lankans, and roughly translates to \"dude\".\n- There's no safe version of \"you\" that a young man can use on another that he has just met. Most risk using \"machang\", but could result in offense if addressing someone of higher social standing. This is solved by constructing sentences that avoid the word entirely.\n- Most children, especially from my generation, do not feel comfortable using second person pronouns on their parents. They just repeat \"mother\/father\" wherever the word \"you\" is supposed to appear.\n- Sometimes the sentences are spoken with the word entirely omitted (like in Latin) -- \"Can come over here?\", \"Did lock the door?\"","completion":"There are some similar mechanism in Japanese. \"Anata\" is generally considered to mean \"you\" (more formal than the informal\"omae\") -- but it is too familiar for general use (it can often be translated as \"dear\", depending on context). The safest approach is usually name+san.\nJapanese is also often used without pronouns (in general it can be a surprisingly terse language for having rather few grammatical markers).\nI have no knowledge of Sinhalese -- but from the description above it sound surprisingly similar to Japanese. Incidentally, Japanese is so different (grammatically) from many other languages that it is allowed as a \"other\" language when studying linguistics -- along with Maori and certain tribal languages. I wonder if Sinhalese wouldn't qualify as well."}

{"prompt":"I'm a teacher of mathematics at a community college.\nIt appears to me that the crux of the problem is that people, including the guy in the video, confuse problem solving with mathematics.  The utility of mathematics comes in the remarkable fact that a great deal of phenomena can be adequately modeled mathematically.  The focus of an algebra class ought to be in learning the language of algebra.  That is, in manipulating numbers in the abstract.  The application problems ought to be saved for physics, biology, economics, etc.  The result of an emphasis on so called real world problems in high school mathematics is a generation of students who are incapable of correctly manipulating algebraic expressions and equations.\nI recently gave my college algebra class an equation.  It was a simple equation and all of them could solve it.  I then asked them for an example of an equation that had no solution.  Not a single person could provide an answer.  They can solve the word problems in the textbook but don't have the slightest clue about what these mathematical concepts actually mean.\nPerhaps it isn't important that one need to manipulate algebraic objects.  I won't argue with this.  But let's not call solving word problems mathematics.

{"prompt":"There is one crucial aspect of the TV experience this argument leaves out.\nContent - An Apple television would present some cool options for new apps and games, but the lean back experience would be no different than with a current TV. People want their Madmen, football, Nascar, Walking Dead, etc. and you will need to buy that through cable companies (for now). If Apple makes a TV it will look awesome and have some neat tricks, but it will be a \"Dumb Screen\" for whatever comes through the set top box. That seems like a losing solution for Apple.\nI think a more likely scenario is that Apple buys a Cable provider like Comcast and replaces the horrible set top box with an Apple version. Why?\nApple's huge cash position - Apple has more than $50B in free cash and are adding ~$10B a quarter. They have made repeated statements about keeping that money available for one or more major strategic investments. They could conceivably have enough money to buy Comcast by the end of this year.\nWhy this works:\n- Fits their vertically integrated model perfectly. Now Apple will own the customer experience from end to end.\n- Creates a wedge that will force other carriers to offer an Apple set top box.\n- Forces all the content providers to play ball with Apple. If Apple owns the pipes the content co's will lose a lot of negotiating power.\n- It is a great high margin business, well suited to the Tim Cook era where device innovation might be slower.\n- It is a hedge against Net Neutrality. If the cable co's get their way it could negatively impact the Apple UX, especially for iPad.\nIn this scenario Apple can take on a high margin business with a host of barriers to entry and milk it while they reimagine what the TV experience should be for the next 20 years. I have no doubt that we will see a beautiful aluminum TV made by Apple at some point, but if they don't figure out the infrastructure foundation first it will not work.","completion":"Suppose Apple buys Comcast, then what?

{"prompt":"Personally, I think the problem is people trying to be too clever, and loading too much content at once.\nLoading tons of JavaScript means that Facebook loads very slowly on my phone on mobile internet. And what is it needed for? The most the JS needs to do is make a pop-down notifications panel, and do one or two AJAX requests to post comments and \"like\" items. Looking at the Network panel in Chrome, I see Facebook has pulled down 700KB of JavaScript. Why? How could they possibly need that much code?\nFacebook also seems to think that sending full-size images down to my phone, instead of compressed previews, isn't a problem. No wonder the GPU memory is exhausted!","completion":"Yes, I'm sure Facebook and their stable of developers just never thought of that. How silly."}

Most of the blogger types end up writing books (Tim Ferriss is an example I think HN'ers would be familiar with.) I turned down a book deal to go back and do another tech company because that's what I love to do.\nThere is a trend amongst bloggers to start software companies. Clay Collins' LeadPages is a good example; he's a crossover blogger\/Internet marketer turned software company CEO. He just closed $5M in funding for LeadPages led by Foundry Group.\nThere are a few more up-and-comers in the blog world who are crossing over into software, but so far very few have made the leap--I think because the skillset is so different.\nWeird to think that I'm rare, but it's an interesting viewpoint to hear from the tech community."}
{"prompt":"This is my worry with Python. Its a good language, but it is too easy to learn.","completion":"Python tries to make it easier to avoid pitfalls. In contrast to PHP or Perl, Python believes that\n> There should be one--and preferably only one--obvious way to do it.\nEven something like significant whitespace forces everyone to format their code similarly.\nThat's not to say an incompetent programmer can't write horrible code in Python, just that Python tries to make it easier to do the right thing than the wrong thing."}

{"prompt":"\"PHP is overly verbose and terribly inconsistent and lacks powerful methods of abstraction and proper closures and easy-to-use meta-programming goodness\"\nSometimes I wonder how much closures and meta-programming is just code for coding sake.  I've seen lots of examples of 5 line LISP code that does something totally amazing but you don't really know what it means but it's so abstract.  If you have a quick job to do, I don't see that it's a limitation in using a language that requires to build the most straight forward solution.\nPHP is ugly, but for the most part it isn't horrible -- these days you can easily avoid some of the worst parts and concentrate on making code that would be very equivalent to the same code in, say, Java.  PHP is very straight forward -- it means what it says.\n\"Your web framework in PHP probably isn't continuation-based, it probably doesn't compile your s-expression HTML tree into assembler code before rendering it.\"\nThis just sounds like over-engineering the problem.","completion":"The problem is most people building meaningful programs are not people with \"just a quick job to do\". For those people, having abstractions available allows them to focus on the harder problems that actually matter, instead of constantly reinventing the wheel.\nThe mental energy is probably not worth it if you are just building a blog for yourself, but in that case, the mental energy of learning PHP is not worth it either. If the job is really that quick, why are you using dynamically generated content in the first place? HTML one-off's are the most straight forward solution.\nOn the other hand, if you want to build a bulletproof web application, you should probably use powerful tools, figure them out once, and then actually solve your problem."}
{"prompt":"I have long suspected this to be true. That's my argument against mandatory voting, because if people can choose not to vote, they can express they don't know and hopefully leave the result on people who feel they do know.\nHowever, it's a bit unclear how this ties together with Dunning-Kruger effect (which is also used as an argument against democracy). The D-K effect would suggest that if you allow people to express doubt, the experts will doubt more, and overall performance will decrease.\nIt would be interesting if someone did a psychology experiment on that. (I am actually in favor of doing these kinds of demonstrations in high school, because it's in my opinion important for people to understand how democratic voting works, for example the fact that voting won't get you a simple average of the results - which is usually used as an argument against democracy.)","completion":"I'd actually be pretty surprised if the Dunning-Kruger effect applied significantly to politics. There are so many tribal pressures involved that I think that the phenomena involved with Dunning-Kruger would be overwhelmed."}
{"prompt":"I don't care what people say Angular totally suffers from the second system effect.\nhttp:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Second-system_effect","completion":"I think this is more of an impression because Angular 2.0 is embracing many other things that have nothing to do with Angular, like ES6, web components, typescript.\nI notice that with people trying to learn TypeScript, and see that their struggle is with classes, lambdas and modules, not with the type system that is basically the only thing TS adds to ES6.\nIn the end, if you look at it there is not really much to understand and all the other things you will learn anyway with Ember, React, etc. I believe most of this fear will disappear once its released."}
{"prompt":"Bitcoin needs to be understood before it can be used by someone. People's ability to understand bitcoin is the current bottleneck to bitcoin adoption.","completion":"I partially agree but wonder how much the 'average person' truly understands how traditional fiat currency works.

{"prompt":"I support the author and what the bank did is just absolutely wrong and outrageous, but I just want to clarify that this is not a freedom of speech issue. Freedom of speech refers to government restrictions on limiting the right to voice your opinion. The government wasn't involved and he didn't legally have to remove the tweet (but I would have removed the tweet as well if it threatened my job). I totally support the author, but this is not a freedom of speech problem. Sometimes we limit what we say because there can be negative consequences that have nothing to do with the government.\nI recommend creating an anonymous Twitter account to remove negative pressure that can affect employment.","completion":"It's worth noting, particularly given where the story occurred, that this is a US-centric take on what \"Freedom of Speech\" means, and really doesn't generalize well."}
{"prompt":"Are there any non-self employed developers\/engineers here that are still being \"forced\" to work 9-to-5 or similar?\nBecause in my experience, for most software centric companies it's just a paper obligation which is ignored with mutual agreement as long as the job gets done.\nIn fact, I don't know of anybody still forced to work 9-to-5 without a contextual reason (opening hours, shifts etc).","completion":"There is no such thing as job gets done.

It's also simple with fixed instruction timing, meaning it can be well tested, leaving few places for a back door to hide.  The original hardware probably predates any surveillance programs (edit: and the silicon is being publicly reverse engineered by enthusiasts).  There's a satisfying feeling of control, when in charge of a computer that is simple enough to understand in its entirety.\nA Z80 won't be the fastest computer, but it might be useful for some tasks.  Updates to the Z80, starting with FPGA cores, will be faster than the original, and might form a basis for enthusiasts to develop further.

Lead gen remains a multibillion dollar industry.\nThere are many companies with six\/seven\/eight figure sales of unsexy software, not all of which is SaaS on a monthly basis yet.  (Though it probably should be :) ). Time tracking, invoicing, collaboration, and all the other usual suspects for freelancers each support more than a dozen companies.

(e.g. Solving the problems of multi property landlords... with software.  There's one guy whose supports four families with a very specialized spreadsheet wrapped in a Swing app.)\nTraditional web page hosting continues to make money.  (Not everyone loves VPSes or AWS.  Your local bakery has to get on the net somehow...) There are ecosystems around e.g. wordpress themes and shopping carts for getting the Fortune Five million on the Internet.  These support marketplace sites, affiliates, etc etc.\nNiche publishing plus ads remains lucrative in many sectors.  If you dominate the Internet for Christmas cookie recipes, that is about equivalent to a full-time job as a cookbook author.

Anyway, that's an argument for another day.\nTo get back to the topic, Non-Indians may benefit from the patent regime; but they got the products here in the first place.\nIn short, the \"refutation\" is a simple quid pro quo: the foreigners manufacture most drugs, and they get the most patents. There is no argument here on whether patents are bad, it is a stupid defense of an idiotic method of patent grants. Most Indian pharma firms have no meaningful R&D, they make their profits on generics.\nSocialists like the present government will never understand a free market, if they want these expensive drugs for free, they have to pay for them somehow. Not by abusing a bad patent system which is protectionist. Either they should abolish patents (which is the best way) and take the results, or they start applying patents the ostensible way they are meant to be applied, which is to pay attention to whether the pharma breakthrough is big enough to merit a patent, or not.","completion":"Although I agree with you that the premise of their defense is rather nonsensical, in this particular case (Novartis\/Glivec) it was no socialistic move of policy but rather a prudent decision in clear-cut evergreening.

But, probably through the weight of every single developer using them for absolutely everything, the bugs have been ironed out.\n> Something is wrong if most programs don't run instantaneously.\nWhy?

It's a great way to turn all your problems into distributed problems. And what's not set up is any sensible way to send even basic data structures around. \"pipes and sockets\" send streams of bytes. In 2014, if I want to send an object, a function even - heck, if I want to send an inert struct - from one process to another, I'm basically stuck. The least-bad option is probably to write out the object definition in Thrift IDL, generate a bunch of code and then write a bunch more code to map back and forth with my actual program datatypes. It's hard to express quite how much it sucks, but many people have tried and failed to come up with something better.\n> Don't write temporary files to disk, ever.\nIf you're building new executables for everything you're either doing something wrong, or you don't care about the space you're wasting. The right way to do these tiny tweaks is in an interactive, workbooky environment like ipython. If you like that style of programming.\n> Everything is so complex that you need to isolate yourself from as many libraries and APIs as possible.\nAbsolutely backwards. Everything is so complex - and using libraries so easy - that you should use libraries for everything.

{"prompt":"Some things that would be banned under this bill:\n\u2022 using a drone to patrol the freeway looking for drunk drivers (well, technically they could use a drone to look but they would not be able to send a ground officer to cite the drunk driver),\n\u2022 using a drone to track the getaway car from a bank robbery,\n\u2022 searching for a child who has been taken without authorization by a non-custodial parent.\nIn the first example, a drone COULD be used to patrol the freeway looking for disabled cars or accidents, but if any criminal activity were observed during such patrols the evidence from the drone could not be used against the criminals.\nThis is typical Rand Paul--it is designed to sound good and make it look like he is looked out for The People on some important issue, but the bill is written to be so overly broad that it won't have much chance of actually passing--which I suspect is fine with Paul.\nAnother example of that was an amendment he tried that would have made it so that former Congressmen who become lobbyists lose their benefits. Sounds like a good idea, right? Of course it does--but then when you check the details you find that \"lobbyist\" is defined so broadly as to include anyone who gets money from the Federal government or gets money by working for someone who gets money from the Federal government.\nFor instance, if a former Congressman is a physician, and after leaving Congress goes to work at a rural medical clinic--and that clinic accepts payments from Medicare, that physician would be a lobbyist under Rand Paul's amendment and would lose his benefits.\nOf course that amendment went nowhere, but now Paul can paint himself if he wishes as a guy who tried to fight the corrupting influence of former Congressman becoming lobbyists.","completion":"I read the bill again, and it is even more badly drafted than I had thought. Basically, no drone use to gather evidence for any crime is allowed, if done by anyone who receives money from the Federal government, unless they have a warrant.\nThere are some exceptions: border patrol to combat illegal immigration and illegal importation of controlled substances, specific terrorist threats identified by homeland security from specific organizations or individuals, and exigent circumstances. That last basically means there is a life in imminent danger and the drone is operated by a law enforcement party, which is defined as a party that is paid by the Federal government to investigate or prosecute crimes against the United States.\nSo, if a traffic monitoring drone operated by local police saw a hit and run, they could not use the drone to track the hit and run driver. The exigent circumstances exception would not apply because (1) there is no imminent danger to life, and (2) even if there was local police may not be a law enforcement party, as that is limited to parties that deal with crimes against the United States, not local and state crimes.\nOr if a drone operated by NOAA for weather research spotted a crime in progress where someone was in imminent danger of being killed, and the NOAA drone operators then used the drone to monitor this and gather evidence, they would be in violation of the law and the evidence would be inadmissible. The exigent circumstances exception would not apply because NOAA is not a law enforcement party.\nThere are about 500 comments on this on Reddit, and almost all of them indicate people think this is about stopping the government from sending drones over your backyard to spy on you.\nLegislation to do that would be a good thing. This is not that legislation."}

I can certainly understand including SSH support, but I don't want what is pretty much the only remaining viable non-Unix platform to start bundling horribly dated and clunky Unix-like commands and bloated GNU tools.","completion":"\"the only remaining viable non-Unix platform\"\nWhy do you think that is? As in, why is everyone else on unix (like toolchains)? Why do you think pretty much the entire tech-stack  of mobile and web companies has moved to Linux or BSD as the default choice.\nThe reason is clear. The unix \"small tools connected by text based pipes\" philosophy has won. Whether disaffected powershell users find it clunky or not is not the point. Unix tools are the lingua-franca of developers everywhere.\nThere are many reasons for this but the most important is that the commandline toolset for managing a machine from a remote terminal has always been the most important UI  for unix over the last forty years. You can call it \"dated\". The industry calls it \"the standard\".\nThe irony here is that Microsoft itself has come to the realization that they have to follow where the developer ecosystem is inexorably marching en mass. There will of course be a certain percent of  holdouts clinging to their powershells. But now they'll be fighting against not only the linux'er and BSD'rs. But Microsoft management itself."}

Apple relented, and they are now turning a different crank with the big subscription tax.  They are playing a game of monopoly here.  It's the same kind of game Microsoft played in the 1990's and by attrition have lost to the Linux\/OSS movement.\nApple currently holds one trump card with Safari on IOS devices though.  By restricting HTML5 Audio controls, and rendering engine speed, it prevents games and music web apps from being viable inside the browser.","completion":"We're really nowhere near it at all. The basic economics is that the app market and the exposure from actually being in the app market is just far too massive for that to happen.\nI'm also amazed at how often the myth that one day we'll all be using really crappy Html5 apps continues. Html5 compared to native apps done by an average developer just plain sucks, no amount of 'HTML5 web apps == AWESOME!' pretending and wishing will ever change that.\nWe'll have HTML6 in, what, 2025 maybe?

Because of this discretionary aspect, lower levels of the pyramid, we're unlikely to question the creation of complex and funky new products specifically designed to overcome impediments to maximize that short term bonus.\nWhen this giant \"ponzi\" scheme began to collapse, I saw how those same greedy senior executives proceeded to panic and destroy significant strategic parts of the business solely to stop the leakage of their bonus pool and  try and cosmetically dress up the banks short term results to justify and maintain those 6-8 figure bonuses they had thought they were going to receive.\nMany of these executives later \"resigned\" or were \"retired\" by their boards who should have been accountable for the damage reaped by these masters of gaming. Most of them(I think all of them!) retained huge bonuses all at the expense of the shareholders and employees. Writing off 100's of millions of $ of shareholder and depositor value. With middle class retail shareholders, depositors, and employees paying the price of this borderline criminal behavior.\nMost galling to me is that one of these executive used some of his \"hard owned bonus\" to have a faculty\/ building at my alma mater named after him.

The platform is what they care about, \"like Google cares about search\".\nIf an app is buggy and fixes or new features don't turn up the end-user blames the app vendor.

Of course, that came with other sacrifices, but I considered it worth it at the time.\nIn doing so, I ended up hanging out with a wide, wide variety of homeless people. Some were punk kids who wanted to reject society\/capitalism, many of whom were from broken homes. Some were mentally handicapped. Some had done enough of some sort of drug that they were completely fried. A few seemed very intelligent - one lost his job as a physics professor when he had sex with one of his students, and his family was so ashamed they wouldn't take him in.\nSaying things like \"homelessness is a choice\" is true for some subset of people, but completely untrue for others. Most of the homeless I hung out with were very affluent and had iPhones and MacBooks (you don't find many forced homeless pitching VCs in Palo Alto), but when I was in the city it was a different story.

{"prompt":"The problem is that this encourages lazy development.  Many developers love the ability of tools like Tomcat that allow you to run your web app inside of the application server itself, rather than having to configure a pesky Apache server.\nThe problem this creates is that once a developer has it running on their own machine inside Tomcat (or now this PHP built-in webserver) the app is probably coded in such a way that it will ONLY run inside this server, and will never scale.  What's more, they often turn it into a production application with real customers depending on it, and blame you if you can't make it scale to handle hundreds or thousands of users.\nThis is the problem with using \"built in\" webservers.  It encourages developer laziness, and encourages people to kick bad code over the fence to the operations team who has to make it reliable and run in production.  Never mind that a built in PHP webserver will never scale to meet the needs of more than a few users.","completion":"PHP in general encourages a whole lot worse things than lazy development.

{"prompt":"I have mixed feelings about algorithmic interview questions. There is the camp that says that you shouldn't memorize something you can look up, but I am of the opinion that having something memorized fundamentally changes the flow of thought.\nIf you just know the lookup times of various datastructures, your thought process is much less jumbled than someone who must look them up while problem solving.\nI'm not suggesting that it's necessary for someone be able to whiteboard an implementation of a red-black tree, but knowing what it is, and its advantages and disadvantages compared to an AVL tree or something is very useful.\nAs an aside, in a graduate CS class I took (about search engines), the prof asked \"What is the lookup time of a balanced binary tree\" to various students, two of whom gave wrong answers before she got to me. One said \"n lg n\" and the other said \"n\". It was evident that they were basically guessing.\nMy point is that if you actually understand what a binary tree is, the lookup time of it should be obvious. Same for most other basic datastructures, linked list, hash table, etc. I think asked basic, high-level questions about these are totally fair game.","completion":"If you just know the lookup times of various data structures,\nThe problem isn't knowing complexity, but rather with expecting someone to code something elaborate from memory while being timed, watched, and judged by a stranger.  \"Code a Fibonacci heap right now, live, with no references.

There are other ways to arrange content. I've got my own single-file Python static site generator, which could handle a blog, I guess, but it would seem odd to crown that one application.

In practice, this works quite well as a more flexible option type for the simple either\/or types (either there was a value or an error).","completion":"> This returns the zero value of the value type in the map if the key doesn't exist in the map.\nWow, that's quite horrible (for a static language, anyway).

{"prompt":"I don't think robotic cars will ever happen, and I'll explain why.\nLet's look at the recent MetroNorth railroad accident. Immediately afterwards, people were inevitably throwing around the idea of \"why do we need train drivers at all?\". The reason we need drivers is to satisfy a fundamental human misconception:\nA while back, the DC Metro installed an automated train control system, with the intent of making the system independent of human operators. They flipped the trains onto automatic, and for a while everything ran fine. Then, one day, a sensor failed and one train plowed straight into the back of another at full speed while it was sitting in the station. That was the end of automatic train control in DC.[1]\nKeep in mind that railroad traffic is a much more controlled environment than the open road.\nEveryone knows that people make mistakes. We're (mostly) all engineers here, and we understand that technology is also flawed, like its creators. However, the public at large has this opinion that technology is magic; computers _don't_ make mistakes. The second that belief is proven wrong, people are immediately afraid of it.\nMaybe one day a few robot cars will make it onto the road. But then someone is going to get killed by one. And despite these robotic cars having a stellar record up until their first accident, especially when compared to their human-operated counterparts, they will be taken off the road so fast your head will spin.\n[1] http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/June_2009_Washington_Metro_trai...","completion":"I agree that people think computers are magic and as soon as one fails they get out their pitchforks, but I disagree that automated cars will never happen.

Next I could see an expansion on cruise control.\nIts a combo between marketing new features and iterating on current technology.\nI think the invention of the automated car will be a gradient, not a sudden occurrence."}

I've done all the sleep hygiene stuff such as CBT or forced sleep deprivation, but it doesn't seem to work.\nI've been through various doctors, and I'm seeing a psychiatrist right now to deal exclusively with the sleep issue.

{"prompt":"HTTPS everywhere would solve this, and the Comcast Javascript injection - I wonder how many more people will deploy things like this before that happens?","completion":"https is the wrong solution. that is for preventing others from seeing what you're sending\/receiving, not verifying the integrity of what is sent\/received. well, it does do that too, but it adds extra unneeded overhead by encrypting everything. Besides, the ISP can easily man-in-the-middle any connection you make and then inject their ads into the webpage, even if you use https.\nThe correct solution is signing the webpage (but not necessarily encrypting it). More technically, that means the server\/website would hash the source of the webpage, and then send the webpage, the signed hash, and if needed, the cert it used to sign the hash. Upon receiving both the webpage and the signed hash, the browser would then check to make sure that the signature can be trusted (using a chain of trust the same way we do with certs for https pages already),  hash the webpage source it received, and then verify that that hash matches the signed hash it received from the website.\nIt doesn't matter if any of that is sent in plaintext, because there is no sensitive information, and as long as the hashing algorithm used is strong (ie sha2 family, not md5), then the isp can do fuck all to inject javascript."}

However, I've recently started using bitcoins for some tiny transactions and found out something I didn't expect: They're EASY PEASY to use... much easier than papal, credit cards, or even cash!\nFor those of you who don't know. A bitcoin \"bank account\" can be conjured out of thin air using randomness and some crypto algorithms. It consists of only two numbers, a public \"bitcoin address\" and a \"private key\". (kinda like an RSA key pair).\nThe moment you've created these two numbers, you can say to someone \"hey, send your $$$ to my address\". Then, any time in the future you can withdraw money out of the account via your private key. This last step (withdrawing your money) is actually the ONLY step that requires any real effort at all (installing software on your PC, or trusting an online wallet site) and that's STILL super easy.\nEDIT: I think I ended up sounding too much like a cheerleader in this post...

{"prompt":"IMHO, writing software is actually an excellent example of an engineering task. The reason we see all these failures in software development is, in fact, that most software developers are NOT engineers. This is where all this pain comes from.\nThe role of engineering is to apply a theoretical model\/representation of a physical fact, in order to achieve a desired result. The role of science is to provide these models with maximum accuracy.\nThe better a model is (equations, empirical laws...), and the better the engineer masters this model, the more accurate will be the expected results.\nProgramming languages, frameworks and patterns are scientific models, designed to represent the working of a computer. Bugs and unexpected behaviors in a program are due to a bad application of these models. If you know exactly what you are doing (i.e. you have a deep understanding\/knowledge of these models), there is no reason for you to observe some unexpected failures. The more experience you have, the better you understand these models, and the more productive you are.\nOf course this is just theory: in practice, things are getting quickly complicated and it is humanly impossible to predict everything that will happen - that's why testing exists. But my opinion is one would see much less failures in software development if developers were actually experienced engineers. Many developers today have no idea what they are doing, essentially because they are juniors and inexperienced. Unlike engineers, they are not trained to mentally play with the theoretical tools they use, so they cannot predict the results. And yes, at this point software development becomes more an art than an engineering task. It's like juggling without being able to predict the trajectory of the balls.","completion":"A while ago I had an argument with a chemical engineer about exactly this. He claimed that software engineering is an immature field and that we will eventually learn how to apply engineering principles to get more reliable programs.\nWhen I countered that you mostly don't even know what you're modelling and that the design state space is much larger in software, he retorted that all sorts of things can go wrong with just a single pipe in a chemical plant but that it doesn't stop reliable plants from being built.\nBut he didn't get it: that pipe is a component in a well understood framework. It's nothing like the unexpected things you get in software. The software equivalent is that of a buggy component whose specification is well understood - if you rewrite the component, you'll get what you expect. In software, proper specification is the rub.\nI have worked with many electrical and electronic engineers (I studied CS) and not one of those engineers was on average better at writing reliable software. They did try hard to specify their systems in advance, but the actual systems soon started diverging from their specifications.\nI grant that the absence of evidence is not evidence of absence, but it is equally wrong to keep maintaining in full faith (and without convincing evidence) that software development is an engineering discipline.\nI have never seen anyone argue convincingly for nor against the engineering approach in software. If anyone has done a study on this, I would love to read it."}

{"prompt":"When you look at places like Fox News objectively there are the same problems. It is always a challenge for a media outlet to maintain high editorial standards, when those standards put it in conflict with the very people who provide the money to operate.\nI give major props to folks resigning over having their integrity compromised.","completion":"People demand sensationalist validation of their preferred viewpoints. Most news is dependent on advertising, which means it must maximize viewership to remain competitive. News outlets that use this model have an existential incentive to utilize cheap tricks and sensationalize to drive up viewership and emotional investment in their properties. They will never be able to overcome that as long as that business model is in place.\nNPR and BBC are good because their viewership numbers don't matter nearly as much."}

I can understand why many hate the idea of spending most of one's life as a nine-to-five worker doing things one doesn't exactly care about. I hate this idea too. But, if we applied this attitude on the scale of the whole society, would it not collapse?

{"prompt":"Sometimes the EU regulators seem to have such forward thinking and great ideas. I don't feel this is one of those times. A browser selection screen as a legal requirement, as well as the decision that they have to offer Windows without Media Player installed, seem to me to just be ridiculous requirements levied on Microsoft in an age where these decisions are increasingly irrelevant. There's no browser selection screen required for Windows RT or Windows Phone. Nor is there a requirement for browser selection on OSX, iOS, Linux distros, Android, or ChromeOS (imagine if that were the case...). In fact, the majority of those platforms require you to use the built-in browser, something Microsoft has never done with IE on the desktop. There's always been the choice of what software you want to install, up to the point when mobile devices gained popularity.\nWhat the EU is trying to do is make competition more fair. What they're doing, in effect, seems to be making sure Microsoft has all the disadvantages the legislators can legally throw at them. I worked at a company that did this for employees it wanted to fire, making new requirements that couldn't possibly be met and when the employee failed they were fired for not meeting them. It's obvious the EU wants to fire Microsoft, in an age where competition has never been so fierce (and not due to a browser ballot).","completion":"I can't speak for the others but at least Android allows you to use any web browser you want (for example Firefox, Opera, Chrome).

Sweden offers lots of English master programmes and has introduced fees for non-EU citizens (EU citizens have to be treated the same as own citizens in this regard under EU law ).

I mentioned this elsewhere already, but it is actually a pretty good value. The chassis itself is not a terrible expense, and it's totally passive.

Happy to answer more on that directly via my profile or this thread.","completion":"Rude: A site that optimizes for speed to gain an SEO boost, does not deserve this SEO boost. A site like Pinterest should optimize for speed, regardless of what Google says.\nIf you turn back an experiment meant to enhance usability and engagement, you show that you care more for search engines than for search engine users. You are of course free to place your priorities so that your business survives, but then you can't make a claim to the woes of a whitehat SEO and you will drown in a turmoil of mystification and algo update-fears.\nI do not understand why they even experiment with javascript rendering to increase the page-speed when they do not even currently defer loading of javascript to <\/body>. There are a lot of requests that could be combined into a single request and they could save over 50%(!) of the resource size by minifying html and lossless compression of the pinned images on pinimg.com. The mobile site gets a pagespeed score of 58 \/ 100. This could be 90+ \/ 100. It should be 90+ \/ 100 before you even think of javascript rendering.

That would seem to be a path to spending lots of time and money on research.\nTo be fair, composites and aerospikes are well-tested, and methane has some good qualities and no obvious problems as a rocket fuel. (I don't know what they intend for pressurization; perhaps they want to boil both fuel and oxidizer to create pressure? Seem like a non-standard technique anyway.) And it's not like you can buy rocket hardware OTS, so everything you do is a development project. But none has flown on a real vehicle. Picking one would be ambitious. Four just seems like compounded risk.\nScaled Composites has had plenty of trouble with their seemingly-simple hybrid engine. You may think a technology is researched enough or simple enough to use without much danger, but rocketry is an extreme environment and can hold lots of surprises at scale and in the margins.\nSpaceX, on the other hand, has only done one really revolutionary thing: cost discipline. Mostly through simplicity. Which is a pretty important contribution to the world of rocketry. Much more important than any particular nozzle or engine improvement.\nThe Firefly Alpha should be a nifty rocket if they can get it flying without spending too much money--but the history of rocket development doesn't suggest that'll be easy.","completion":"Methane is simpler in some ways -- no helium, for example. The big question marks here are composites and aerospike.\nAerospikes have been tested but have not (as far as I know) flown.

This causes congestion on that bridge when the other 10 bridges are moving fine.\nVerizon is saying, use a different bridge they are all open.\nNetflix is saying, add more lanes to the one I use because I'm delivering loads to people who ordered it.\nBoth are valid arguments. However, one thing to consider is that Netflix could switch ISPS tomorrow and start dumping their load on a different bridge.\nRealistically it's absurd that Netflix isn't use a whole variety of ISPs to manage the load themselves.

{"prompt":"This says more about the arbitrary nature of using city boundaries for studying home pricing than anything else. San Francisco certainly has high prices, but it also has one of the smallest footprints of any major city, and has lots of nearly-indistinguishable residential areas that are adjacent but fall outside its boundaries, particularly to the South and East.

{"prompt":"It absolutely did.  You may have forgotten, but the early success of iTunes\/iPod was in being able to organize your music and get it on your device.  iTunes\/iPod was the first to really get this right on any kind of scale.  And, compared to the competition of the time, they really nailed it.  So, a phone that had that integrated was a really big deal, even if it couldn't run any apps (as the first iPhone did and couldn't).","completion":"GGP is talking about the iPod, not the iPhone.

Heinlen's \"Solution Unsatisfactory\" was written with a very similar solution in mind ( http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Solution_Unsatisfactory ).\nThat said, that is perhaps the silliest way of using drones if one meant business."}
{"prompt":"It's too bad there's no way to assign a universal \"reputation\" score to the various pundits out there so that readers can better assess the value of their published predictions. Michael Pachter, for instance, has been wrong on a number of occasions (he predicted Sony would dominate the current console generation and Nintendo would languish and MSFT would be #2 -- at least he got the last part right).\nLike the iPad which many pundits couldn't figure out, the consumers never wrote off Netflix and that's pretty much all that matters.","completion":"The Long Now Foundation put up longbets.org to encourage some kind of accountability for predictions."}

{"prompt":"My University released a web based timetable system that was absolutely shocking - it was an ASP.net based site with the kind of unfriendly interface you expect from a 1990's era intranet site (hint: utterly utterly horrible, it produced one timetable PER MODULE rather than a single combined timetable and every time you selected a module it would refresh the page). I was hungover the day before term started and rather than use that system I hacked together an easier to use alternative from my bed using python + flask in literally 60 minutes and released it[1].\nThe administration went crazy when hundreds of students started using it and asked me to take it down.

{"prompt":"Why don't more people walk out of interviews?  Especially if someone set you up to fail, quite literally: interviewing for the wrong job.  It's a waste of my time, it's a waste of your time as a company.\nOn top of that, if you're going to throw out dickish comments like the article states (paraphrase: \"ask your friend, he'll know the answer\"), I wouldn't stick around.  Is that the atmosphere at the company?  Agree or disagree with the interview style, comments like that would piss me off to no end.  Start a game of needling and insults?  You know what, I've had enough.","completion":"\"Why don't more people walk out of interviews?\"\nThey freak out.  I got blacklisted at a cellphone company for doing that a couple decades ago.  I found that out via a friend on the inside.  Basically I was looking for, and applied to get a lab bench job (basically a spectrum analyzer \/ communication analyzer jockey, beneath my ability, but it was an exciting growing company etc) and they wanted me to be a junior roving field tech, basically I'd help the real field techs carry heavy stuff into the building and then (literally) mow the lawn while the real tech worked.  And I went to school for X years to run a lawnmower... uh huh...\nIf you think its mortifying for the candidate, imagine how the HR rep looks when you walk out, thus making a fool out of them.  Note that I wasn't sarcastic or caustic or anything when I left, after all, I had lots of friends \/ acquaintances on the inside and telecom is a very small world.  Lots of hand shaking and \"you have a nice facility here but I'm not interested in the position\" and so on.  I got word from my inside contacts that the HR girl was fuming with rage and swore after I made a fool of her by walking out, that my resume would never pass her desk again in any capacity, etc.\nCompanies are always doing stupid stuff, just hopefully not too often, and they're at least partially interested in how you'll respond.  So imagine you work there and someone in upper management makes the worlds dumbest presentation to the division, they're terrified you're going to laugh at them and walk out.\nWhen I was younger and (even more) stupider, stuck at an interview I decided I didn't really want, I started flirting with the attractive HR staffer, which didn't work out, but it was fun at the time.  Times were different back then, now a days politely asking a woman out at work would probably get you fired or arrested."}

That punishment is enough.","completion":"Dvorak was more than a messenger he was the creator & instigator...\nWould you argue he's just \"blogging\" so fact-based reporting is optional?\nDvorak was pushing the limits of responsible journalism (similar to TechCrunch at times).\nWe agree on one thing: his credibility is taking a huge hit, rightfully so."}
{"prompt":"I don't understand why they require ethnic proportions to stay close to population averages.\nThey don't reject high-performance black athletes for lower performing, asian athletes.

In both cases they're trying to put together the best team. Right or wrong, the idea is that having diversity of experiences improves the academic experience for everyone. I don't know why people have such a hard time understanding this. It's fair to disagree with the idea, but it's completely different from racism."}
{"prompt":"What if the new capital is creativity?  The new model for \"work\" is OSS?  Replace money with creativity in the definitions of capitalism.

{"prompt":"None of those have a touch based UI.  Touch means finger touches.  Very different from a stylus which is only touching one or two pixels at a time.  This is very easy to sense because the stylus pushes two layers together physically and effectively is closing swithces.  A touch is much difeferent, a finger is an amorphous blob over many pixels of a varying shape, and Apple had to figure out how to resolve that into a single pixel you intended to touch (so not the center) and ignore other things like knuckles on the screen, etc.\nThis is a major invention and a major difference, and that is just one part of what made the iOS touch UI.\nThis is the fundamental problem- you and others say nonsense like this, and I don't know if you're simply not well informed about the nature of these technologies, or you don't care and are making arguments because of ideology that you think will work propagandistically.  I mean, I guess ofr many people they don't care that they aren't the same thing, they can just pretend like they are in debates like this, right?\nI really don't know which. I keep hearing people claim that Apple stole from Xerox[1] and here you imply that the palm might have come before the newton and that it is up for debate.\nWhat's next?  The Mac stole from windows?\nSeriously, what level of basic understanding of the history and nature of these technologies can I expect here on Hacker News?  And do you get off the hook for repeating this nonsense simply because it fits your anti-apple ideology?\n[1] I shouldn't need this footnote, but due to the aforementioned ignorance or dishonesty, I do.  Apple licensed Xerox's early research into what later became the GUI by selling them pre-IPO Apple stock which made Xerox a pretty penny and would be worth over a billion now if they had never sold it.","completion":"None of those have a touch based UI. Touch means finger touches.\nThis is dishonestly revisionist, given how common it was to see people thumbing through applications on Palm devices.

{"prompt":"I think the mature thing to do, as cynical as this might sound, is to realize that the government is obscenely out of touch with its constituency, and stop going to them for help. Instead, influence the influencers.\nAt the end of the day, all companies have is customers. If the customers stop utilizing their services, the companies are forced to stop pushing their anti-consumer agendas into legislation. Part of this is utilizing the Internet, as it now is, to circumvent the old ways of doing things.\nEssentially, while it is free, startups should be focusing on helping consumers circumvent traditional industries.\nWe all hate banks as they are. Let's reinvent them.\nWe all hate telecoms. Let's try to create startups that can compete with them.\nWe all hate loan institutions. Let's disrupt the loan structure, allow people to privately invest in one another on a micro scale.

{"prompt":"Skeumorphism is no more an \"easy way out\" than black Helvetica on a white background is an \"easy way out\". They can both be used appropriately, or used badly and in excess.\nThe address book in OSX is an example of bad skeumorphism -- it's a fake book with pages that don't actually turn, trying to shoehorn \"advanced\" computer technology into a visual representation that doesn't work. It's a bad metaphor, a bad analogy. It confuses more than it helps.\nThe \"Notes\" application on OSX is a fantastic use of skeumorphism. The legal-pad look shows us at a glance that it's for taking notes, which a plain white background wouldn't do. The analogy between individual note documents and pages is perfect. Anyone can use it instantly, without worrying where documents are saved or anything like that.\nThe fundamental question is, are design choices helping or hindering understandability and usability? Apps and the web have evolved conventions like share icons and tabs and underlined\/colored links, etc. which people understand. Skeumorphism just adds vocabulary from the physical world to the toolbox.\nAnd in the opposite direction of skeumorphism, I think the SVBTLE blog platform itself goes too far to the minimalist. I can't tell people's blogs apart, because they all look virtually identical -- that's bad design. And what the heck is the \"kudos nipple\"? Why do you hover instead of clicking? A simple thumbs-up icon would be understandable by everyone, which is almost skeumorphic in its own way, since it refers to a physical thumbs-up... Reference to the physical world can be a very useful thing.","completion":"Wow, that 'kudos nipple' is terrible.

{"prompt":"That programming is a talent is not a myth, and while my life is currently devoted to developing a platform to encourage more people to learn the basics of computer science, I will certainly never say \"anyone can learn how to code\" any more than I'd say \"anyone can become a concert pianist\" or \"anyone can become a master painter.\"\nGood programming is an art, and requires talent on the part of the programmer. There's nothing wrong in saying that. The issue is that there are thousands and thousands of potentially great programmers who simply never try programming, just as there are thousands and thousands of never-will-be concert pianists. But many children take piano lessons just in case. Why can't they also take coding lessons?

{"prompt":"Having heard numerous accounts of the Google hiring process, both successful and unsuccessful, I'm convinced that it serves a dual role. In addition to brining in qualified employees, I believe it's intent is to reject qualified candidates. Those qualified candidates will end up being engineering leaders in companies that Google interacts with and the more that they can maintain the impression that Google engineers are the best of the best, the easier those interactions will be and the better received Google products will be. It also means that when Google calls and invites someone to interview, they almost never get turned down.","completion":"If this is the actual goal they are not even bad at hiring, which I can testify personally, they are also bad to be hired at.

Then release it as some handwavy, semi-plausible \"follow-up\" to the previous SQL-injection, urging everyone to upgrade in small caps.\nYes, a handful of blackhats will see through the bluff.

{"prompt":"Why do the commerical banks store it with the central bank? Why not store it themselves?","completion":"Because the alternatives is basically to store reserves at the central bank or to store them in cash, and storing in cash is costly.\nThe reason for this is that banks within a banking regulation\/currency area is a closed system - reserves are created when a loan is made, and cannot be removed from the system until that debt is repaid. A bank can store it in actual cash or in reserves in another bank, but that would simply move the problem to that bank. They need to be able to store their reserves, and they end up doing that at the central bank."}

How this is any better is anyones guess.\nI'd be interested in TV owning situation for those with kids though. Not having a TV when you have kids is borderline abuse IMHO. Kids should have some exposure to popular culture, and be able to talk about the same stuff as their peers.\nIt's like some people who use adblock though.

Whenever someone came to visit, he told them the TV was being repaired.\nApparently soon after he left home at 18, my Grandad then went out and bought a telly, and soon after got the biggest satellite package he could.\nAnyway, I don't watch TV - where would I find the time for reddit and StumbleUpon if I did?"}

Do they have individual shoppers who just do their thing as though they were individuals, and then deliver?  Are those individuals employees or freelancers?\nI'm guessing Costco would be a bit reluctant to formally allow something like this, as I also presume that one reason they get lower prices from suppliers is that they only sell to members, so there is less of a perception that a supplier is undercutting other retailers by letting Costco sell at a reduced price.  A sort of price discrimination... but if stuff gets resold without a markup to bring the price in line with other retailers it would make their negotiations more difficult.","completion":"Costco executive membership offers 2% rebate on everything you buy - this is probably a non-trivial source of revenue for Instacart."}

Or tell galileo that he was wrong because he didn't have a degree in astronomy.\nValid scientific investigations don't require scientific training.  This person, who wrote some code and plotted some numbers on a graph may know more about math and programming and data visualization than many of those running weather stations, so it isn't productive to say this person has nothing to contribute because he's someone without scientific training.\nYou don't even know that statement is true.

The article in question demonstrates otherwise, note they just now fixed one of the problems with anon functions, a relatively new feature.

{"prompt":"I feel like I'm taking crazy pills when I talk about aspect ratios with average consumers. Most people really do believe--probably through HDTV marketing--that wider screens are better. The lion's share of most people's time on the Internet is spent reading and scolling vertically, yet our devices are optimized for watching little sixty second movie clips at a time. Why wouldn't you want to make the 95% case more pleasurable at the expense of a few black bars on the top and bottom of your movie? Besides, most Internet videos need to be upscaled to fill the screen anyways, the detail is mostly interpolated anyhow.","completion":"The reason wider screens are preferred is because of human's field of view.

You could do an awful lot of notifications with subtle sounds, and of course have phone calls, send voice messages or text messages (speech to text) via your phone. Love the filtered notifications idea here though.\nOnce you start adding a screen, the battery requirements go through the roof and you need something very big, at which point it's like a cut-down phone without the internet connection and battery life and size become a constant issue. The Apple watch is chunky and ugly in its current incarnation because of these problems, and unfortunately this device is pretty big too.\nWe need internet connected things which complement phones and enhance our lives, not compete with them in different form-factors. Another thing that'd be nice is some sort of colour epaper scroll for a reader which winds up really tight into a tube.

Who was your tutor because next time I'm at a dinner at my college I'm going to ask him how the fuck did they pass you.\nOur current trend of saying college doesn't matter really starts to be a problem when professional programmers (yeah I'm assuming that the guy in the question is) are asking basic questions like this. This shows that we do need college education for programmers.\nIt also irritates me - this guy could have taken the time to learn all these basics, but for whatever reason he thought it didn't matter, and now he's paying for it.","completion":"SO is not a site for software engineers, it's a site for programmers, regardless of their level of knowledge, education or age.\nAnd by the way, I'd rather work with fellow programmers who don't know what a coroutine is than with an insufferable elitist like your posts make you out to be."}

The problem is that this particular number causes the infinite loop (i.e. the iteration does not improve the error at all) in 80-bit FP, but does not in 64-bit FP.

Or pay the ~$10,000 I've been quoted to build the first iteration, knowing that if it's successful I could employ (or otherwise structure and energise) that technical person to re-create (or revise, but I imagine they'd rather start again) the base code in an improved way, at some future point, possibly to time with a product or market expansion?\nEdit: I appreciate me 'imagining' what an experienced hacker can or can't do may be akin to a blind man imagining colour; but that's also been the feedback from outsourcing companies I've met with.","completion":"This is an interview with a non technical single founder who outsourced a v1, did serious business development, raised capital and then leveraged all this to attract co founders.

{"prompt":"To be honest, I think this is one of the few areas where Joel is off the mark.\nIn my experience, the \"tester\" is a useless position that usually only exists because of a deficiency in one of two areas.\nThe first reason you need testers is that your programmers can't - for whatever reason - turn out code that works. Either they don't sufficiently understand the problem scope, they're overworked, or they're just lazy and don't bother running through enough of their own quality controls before releasing changes.\nThe second area is that you aren't getting the right feedback from customers. Joel uses an example in his article:\nWith long-cycle shrinkwrap software, it can take a year or more to hear feedback from customers.\nThe problem is the cycle is too long. Fix that.\nI find  mostly this is due to more basic things, like separating client service from programming (hello feedback!), allowing salesmen to mollycoddle their clients, or not even bothering to ask or listen.\nThe \"tester\" is the response to the existence of either one of both of the symptom above. By their very existence, they are a sign that you are either working in a company that has placed itself in a less than ideal market (selling enterprise software, for example), is poorly led, or has leadership that doesn't listen.\nAll this thinking hearkens back to computer engineering as building a house; and analogy so flawed that even PG saw fit to write a book with a more apt one.\nThis has been my experience and I have yet to see a situation where it isn't true.","completion":"With respect, I suggest your experience is limited.\nI deploy embedded safety-critical software into establishments such as nuclear naval bases.  We need testers because while the code works (we use formal and semi-formal software derivation techniques) there are, on occasion, unexpected interactions between features.  You need to run through combinations of configurations and actions, and some of it can't be scripted because the interactions are unexpected - the Black Swan principle.\nOur cycle is a long one in part because acquisition programs in government and quasi-governmental organisations are like that.  We can't deploy changes every day into the field.  For one thing, we usually have access.  For another, any change needs associated training and manuals.\nIt would be a waste of a talented programmer to run through the sorts of detailed and exhaustive testing our software has to pass before it will be accepted.\nPerhaps you simply think that my company is placed in a less than ideal market.  I assure you, it's worth being in the game."}

I think the entire package management system has to be based on a more robust transactional infrastructure. Unless the user confirms the success of an upgrade, the system has to be rolled back to its original state. If the system doesn't boot, it must boot straight into the old system version on the next reboot.\nUpgrades should not be something that anyone hesitates to do, but I know Ubuntu users who'd rather install new software on a separate computer instead of upgrading the fragile Ubuntu installation.

{"prompt":"Thank you for this article; very thought provoking.\nMy nitpick:\n> When each student was given a heavy book of MNIST database, hundreds of pages filled with endless hand-written digit series, 60000 total, written in different styles, bold or italic, distinctly or sketchy.\n> ...\n> So, are you going to say that was not the case?\nI understand the point the author is making.  Human brains are really good at taking limited examples and correctly extrapolating them to new cases.  That is, of course, the goal of intelligence.  Machine Learning has gotten better at this generalization, but has a long way to go.  And ConvNets as they exist today will not achieve that, no matter how much training you perform on them.\nThis specific example is inaccurate though.  Let us aggressively simplify and low-ball by saying that humans see at 24fps.  Humans of course don't see in discrete frames, but this simplification doesn't detract from my argument and makes quantifying easier.  So, if you give a human a single page of numbers, and they look at it for an hour, they have now seen >86k examples.  That's 86k examples with twitching saccades, and from both eyes.  That's in just an hour of looking at numbers.\nPrior to being given that page of numbers, most children will have been alive for 4-5 years.  That's 3 billion examples from a wide variety of subjects (we ignore sleeping cycles, because we're already low-balling this fps figure, and because the brain is still learning and visualizing during sleep).\nAnd humans are born with a pre-built visual cortex.  Edge detection, gradient detection, etc. are all already built for us.  CNNs learn that from scratch.\nThe author's real point is still valid, though, don't get me wrong.  I'm just nitpicking.","completion":"Maybe we need a different representation at the upper layers, to capture higher concepts.

In my 20's it was easier to pick up new concepts, with longer short term memory. In my 50's, I have acquired more patterns to apply. The downside, when I was younger, was going down blind alleys that wound up as a dead ends. The downside, when I got older, is misapplying an old pattern instead of synthesizing a new one. That's why I liked working with older people, in my 20's, and now working with younger people. To balance both tradeoffs.\nThe Supreme Court spends much of its time interpreting the patterns that are laid out in the constitution and laws passed by congress. Sometimes it synthesizes a new pattern, which will be interpreted for the next 10's or 100's of years.\nFor copyright, there is some value in recalling patterns from the last few decades. For example, the film industry thought that TV and later VHS would kill their business. Another is when the music industry thought that radio, cassette tapes, and MP3 files would kill their business.\nThe problem of employing experts as the final judge is their bias towards a particular pattern. The time spent going deep in a particular field would mean that they have less time to go broad across all fields. IMO, how to benefit US commerce is about as broad as it gets."}

Detroit is fairly unique in that almost anything you can think up, you're free to just go ahead and do it.  (The cops are too busy even to deal with all of the big, real crimes.)

It seems reasonable to assume that if that were the only differentiating feature you would get more developers (they get to keep more of the money) and so it would get more apps, and the platform would outsell Apple's iPad with its constraints.\nNow granted that is a hell of a hypothetical, but if you can accept the claim that given two otherwise identical products, but one with more developer friendly policies, would allow the developer friendly one to be more successful, then we can talk about at what point the 'value' represented by that can overcome the fact that the product is not an iPad.

Contrast that to the Kindle Fire which started with Android, locked down a lot of stuff that Google doesn't, and that has gained more traction than any other Android based tablet.\nTo me, that shows a market for a non-iPad but with Apple like quality control and predictability. Depending on Amazon's success, Google might just wake up and fix their world (and of course they might not, it would not be the first time a large organization just didn't 'get' it)\nBut you also claim that nobody can exploit these resentments, and certainly Amazon is going to try and seem to have some modest success in that regard.

The iPad\/iPhone is one of the cheapest products on their market segment.\nJust consider that when everybody expected the iPad to be like $999 or $799 on introduction, it came out at $499 -- and the mostly useless copies (now forgotten) that appeared of it, where in the range of $700.\nApple has their margin's with huge economies of scale and huge massive pre-orders of RAM, solid state storage and screen panels."}

Or even just phosphorous-coated pinheads (not the matchstick kind; the CRT kind) with an infrared lamp or blacklight on the other wall?\n- Or maybe, if you don't care about the LEDs only lighting up when on the wall, you could just make them \"permanently\" lit in the same way some exit signs are: put a tiny little bit of something radioactive in there, and then surround that with fluorescent gas in a glass shell.\n- A chemical solution would be very interesting for its own sake.

Put two layers of conductive material down on the map, one on each side of the insulating board, and apply a voltage between them. When you stick in the pin, your \"ring\" contacts the closest layer, the tip the furthest, and so you have a voltage available to power the LED in the head. The voltage would only need to be about 3V or so, so its perfectly safe, you just need a small fuse in case of shorts.\nManufacturing a conductive \"ring\" on a pin would be difficult with machining, so using a conductive paint on top of an insulating paint would be the best option.

It just means it takes fewer people to break ranks from an oppressive government and effectively oppose it.\nThe biggest threat is well paid mercenaries. It always has been.","completion":"How about when we replace the kids with war drones and robots?"}
{"prompt":"\"Even while I was there, we had what I suspect (but have no proof) were incidents of people leaking product plans, roadmaps, etc. (but no IP) to Intel.\"\nI can't imagine Steve Jobs allowing this to happen at Apple.  They have definitely caught people leaking things, and the consequences were swift and unpleasant for the leaker.  Why can't AMD catch these people?  Is there something preventing them from implementing the same kinds of measures to catch leakers as Apple?\n(Using Apple just as an example, of course.  I'm sure there are other companies who find leakers and make an example of them through the legal system.)","completion":"Well AMD is a small fraction of the size of Apple as well. Even more, Apple's business isn't oriented towards cutting into the market share of a large competitor. And there have been significant leaks at Apple."}
{"prompt":"As someone with little background in physics I've always found dark matter to be a very inelegant concept. To introduce a new kind of \"matter\" which can hardly be observed sounds very arcane to me. It reminds me of the Luminiferous aether which was postulated as the medium in which light travels in the late 19th century. I'm looking forward to new theories that can explain what we now observe as \"dark matter\" without having to invent a new kind of matter specifically for it!","completion":"It is normal in physics to use temporary labels for things that are not known. Dark matter is labeled as that because it has properties similar to visible matter. Once we learn more about it, a better name will probably be found, similarly to how the ether concept was replaced by relativity theory."}
{"prompt":"Which problems?  That's a genuine question: the way I see it, C++'s niche is shrinking by the year, as new languages and more powerful computers arise.  So, what's left?","completion":"Cross platform applications? I know that C# apparently has cross platform support but I met with limited success on Mac OSX (perhaps I didn't try hard enough).\nIt is fairly easy to get a cross-platform library and use C++ to write for the main OSes (Mac OSX, Windows, Linux, in no particular order) and then you can also take the same code and compile and run it on your Raspberry Pi and ARM systems.\nI know you could probably do the same with Python but I think small systems would suffer a speed penalty (I even find desktop Python applications slow so I dread to think of GUIs on an ARM written in Python). I reality I have not ever come across a piece of paid software that included a runtime of Python or some scripting language other than Perl, and that clearly wasn't for a GUI app.\nWhat else would you write for all three platforms in? Java? I am curious.\n(I suppose if you are targeting one platform only, then it might make sense to write in languages typically tied to that platform, eg. Obj-C \/ Swift \/ VB \/ C# (as is vastly popular in Windows land))."}

{"prompt":"Rendering on the client makes a lot more sense. By sending the user a template followed by the data necessary to fill it out you only send the structural code once. If the user views 100 pages then that's 99 times you've not had to send the HTML required to display the content. That's good news from a bandwidth point of view, an environmental point of view, and, if you're clever about how you code it, a rendering speed point of view because you only have to replace the content in some DOM nodes rather than repainting the entire template. That can lead to a faster display than swapping in the rendered content for some situations (particularly if the changes are small text  elements and you have a shadow DOM available eg reactjs).\nIf you're doing something very complicated and your users have old or underpowered devices then rendering on the server is sensible, but in the modern web it really isn't appropriate.","completion":"I don't know, it still feels alien to get a response from the server w\/ an incomplete page and then wait for it to be completely rendered. https:\/\/groups.google.com is s a good example of this."}

{"prompt":"\n    It just might be possible that Perl 6's crazy long development process can\n    produce the best-adopted second system around\n\nUnfortunately, I don't share the same optimism as the OP. In the real world, adoption is not only driven by how cool a language is, but the ecosystem of tools and developers around it. There are lots of Perl 5 codebases which won't be migrated because it's too expensive.\nThe true lesson learned for language developers is: Don't break backwards compatibility. Ever.\nThe Python community made this mistake, and they acknowledge it. Guido said this won't happen again. But at least for the case of Python 3, the number of breakages is relatively small, and the migration from 2 to 3 while tedious, it's not that hard. Even so, the migration of the whole ecosystem has been really really slow. But I think in the end the community will move.\nThe Perl case, on the other side, is much worse. Migrating a relatively complex project from 5 to 6 is extraordinarily hard. It's probably the same as a whole rewrite. Also, the community is divided, with some developers keeping the improvement of Perl 5, fixing bugs and adding new features. There is no incentive for migration.\nIf the migration has been so slow for Python 3, which had a much smaller barrier, I don't see how it could be better for Perl 6.\nNew languages are able to develop a new ecosystem when they introduce innovative features, e.g. Rust. But Perl 6 while being a nice language, doesn't seem to have any killer feature compared to mainstream languages.","completion":"> The true lesson learned for language developers is: Don't break backwards compatibility. Ever.\nCertainly true, and yet this is the situation that led to a lot of the hate for C++.\nThe reason for the numerous meanings of the \"static\" keyword for example is because if you introduce more keywords then you might break peoples code that used those proposed keywords as variable names.\nAnd then of course a large percentage of C++'s baggage is due to backwards compatibility with C in the first place. Without that baggage C++ would be a much better language and yet you can't deny C++'s success from that decision.\nSo the moral of the story is that you either make a language nobody uses or you continue to cop flak for all your old decisions forever."}
{"prompt":"Interestingly though, Diesel popularity, at least in my peer group is going down.\n- Modern Diesel engines are very complicated due to their turbos, hence are more brittle and expensive to repair.\n- Price advantage of Diesel is practically not there anymore, but the Diesel model is still more expensive.\n- Modern Gasoline engines have caught up with Diesels in terms of mpg.\nNo one bought a Diesel because it's a Diesel. People were buying it cause the price at the pump was way lower and you could offset your initial higher costs after 50-80k kms.\nSo, the US might just have skipped over Diesel. Happens in other tech as well, see 3g networks, etc.","completion":"As in many pricing situations, e.g. flat rate internet, what gets ignored is the \"insurance effect.\" In the case of flat rate internet, the insurance is against your bandwidth use going way up due to a new application you start to use, and because people are poor judges of future bandwidth needs. In the case of high mpg cars, it is insurance against price shocks. If the petrodollar goes bust, you can still get to your office at a price you can afford, while everyone else scrambles to carpool or buy a high-mpg car.\nSo even if you only break even over the life of the vehicle, you get the potential value of driving to the very end of the Oil Age."}
{"prompt":"Completely respect where you're coming from, but totally disagree. I made a few abortive switches to Vim that didn't last a week because my productivity was too hampered and the environment too extreme & foreign.\nTo a newcomer like me, Vim's built-in help was less than worthless, since you pretty much need to know the Vim term for what you're looking up to find it.

One of the obvious things was that the staff didn't like the militaristic-layout of desks, being on display to others in the organization who had cozy and private retreats to use.\nThe CEO freaked out when I told him we were moving to the opposite side of the office floor (we had a full floor in a standard big-city downtown office building). When we moved over, we had our choice of cubes, open areas (not desks, but full-on tables) and quiet corners. Product management hated it because they \"had to walk over to see what was going on\". It didn't take a lot to figure out the source of frustration with the office environment for the engineering team. After that, I was able to take on the frustrations of the product management group since they could no longer easily impact the engineering team.\nAs it turned out, the engineering team didn't mind working in any combination of those situations, as long as they could kind of pick-and-choose over time.

All of his game programming work, and his several (if prototypical) programming languages, each exploring some unique idea. https:\/\/github.com\/munificent?tab=repositories\nI've always wanted to write a roguelike. I wrote a woefully incomplete MUD a long time ago. It had the interesting (to me) property of representing items and features as .NET assemblies. Servers could link so that a doorway could move players, with their items and effects, seamlessly onto another. If I recall correctly .NET even had the security model to (nominally) support it safely, where all items may invoke only approved engine APIs, and where trusted assemblies might be loaded while untrusted items and their consumers pass through to be loaded again later on another server. The idea was to enable a sort of open web of interconnected MUD worlds. Only ever made it to the tech demo stage; I recall spending a long time on that system, event handling, and other engine features (classic game dev mistake) and never got around to game content! I don't regret the time: it was primarily a project of exploration and the act if building just the engine was its own reward. (Tomorrow I might try to dig up my old source for the MUD but I suspect it will be like http:\/\/www.xkcd.com\/1360\/ )\nAnyway, could anyone recommend a good OSS roguelike that's accessible and easy to hack on?

That fact is very much lacking from the evidence. Many creatures are literally programmed to die as soon as they finish reproducing. This is obviously not the case for humans, but it does show that evolution does not necessarily have our individual best interests at heart.\nWhen we talk about longevity these days, we're not talking about living long enough to raise children \u2014 we're talking about living way past the point where we serve any clear evolutionary purpose.

{"prompt":"No. They did not become a fractional reserve, they became insolvent.  A large portion of the BTC community grossly abuse the term 'fractional reserve', and it's flatly wrong.\nFractional reserves refer to liqudity, not solvency.  If I run a financial institution and I owe depositors $100, but have $10 cash and am owed $100 on top of that, I'm running a fractional reserve.\nIf on the other hand, I'm MtGox, and I owe depositors $100, but have $10 of cash and am owed nothing on top of that, I'm insolvent.  Bankrupt.  And if I keep operating, I am a fraud.\nThis is an incredibly important distinction.","completion":"Gonna have to disagree with it being an important distinction.\nIn times where you can't liquidate assets at a high enough fraction of their \"I deserve this much\" value, then you can't meet your obligations and are thus insolvent as well.  If someone's willing to buy your illiquid assets (or lend on the assumption that they're) at full \"I deserve it\" value, you were still insolvent -- you just got bailed out.\nIf you are otherwise profitable, then a long enough line of credit can return you to profitability.  In that respect as well, an \"insolvent\" institution can become solvent thanks to this added liquidity.\nFor those reasons, I believe that in the interesting cases, liquidity and solvency are too deeply entangled to distinguish.\nSo when MtGox tries to keep the facade up long enough for trading fees to cover the shortfall, then yes, that is different from an \"illiquid but solvent\" bank getting a loan from the Lender of Last Resort ... but it's a different of degree, not kind (edit: fixed wording, thanks dllthomas).

It seems that you are underestimating the size of the market and potential the to make money by writing applications for the Mac.

{"prompt":"Regardless of the origins, if an expression is applied to a different context, it might still cause subconscious associations to form in the human brain. If you hear \"Dutch courage\" often enough, you might subconsciously start to link the Dutch to cowardice. For a more modern example take the word \"gay\". It originally meant \"happy\". Then it meant \"homosexual\". As a result of that second meaning large numbers of people use the word as a synonym for \"unlikable\" or \"bad\". If somebody uses the word in a context like \"that movie is gay\", that reinforces the connection between the concept \"bad\" and the concept \"homosexual\".\nTherefore what's important is not the origins of a word, but its current associations and effects: \"my car was vandalized\" is OK but \"that movie is gay\" is not.","completion":"censoring of the subconcious?"}

{"prompt":"Most of those conflicts are a pretense to funnel trillions of dollars into the economy, but almost always also a fight to maintain spheres of influence. This was certainly true for the Vietnam war, where above all a communist Indonesia had to be avoided, but also obviously for any conflict in the Middle east.\nWhat I find worrying is that the War on Terror is a poor substitute for the Cold War. The enemy is technologically unsophisticated, so there is no chance of a sputnik shock, no real competition to gain the upper hand technologically and therefore potentially less incentive to use the vast resources of the military to fund high technology research as it was the case during the Cold War.\nMoreover the technology developed to \"hunt terrorists\" can be turned against the population much more easily than the rockets, nuclear weapons and computer systems of the past.","completion":"I would argue that the entire point is to destabilize regions.

Even without the weapons, FTL drive implies a magnitudes greater technology than anything a non-FTL race would have.

The lottery commission then picks six distinct integers at random from the set {1..46}, effectively by drawing numbered balls without replacement from an urn. The payouts for May 9, 2011 were $24821 for a match-5 (a ticket that has 5 numbers in common with the set chosen by the lottery), $824 for a match-4, and $26 for a match-3 (http:\/\/goo.gl\/gSTsF).

The long-held serotonin hypothesis has proven to be completely baseless and there is no good evidence that depression has a neurochemical etiology. fMRI data is often used to make the case that depression has neurological rather than psychological origin, but this is very poor reasoning; The brain is not merely a passive vessel for the mind and environmental influences can cause substantial structural changes to the brain, as seen in chess players, sportsmen and myriad other groups.\nIt is entirely possible that the idea of depression is itself a cause of depression, in much the same way that the western presentation anorexia nervosa has been imported into Chinese culture and is slowly replacing the far more common indigenous eating disorder, which presented as idiopathic digestive problems rather than a psychological aversion to food based in body image. It is entirely plausible that the belief that low mood is a medical disorder which cannot be ameliorated by the patient is itself pathological.\nI believe that the only statement we can make about depression with any confidence is this: We aren't sure if \"clinical depression\" describes a phenomena that can be meaningfully thought of and treated as a disease, but we do know that if you do something that you believe will make you feel better, you will feel better.","completion":"A commenter asked for citations, so here are the most important:\nMeta-analysese of the efficacy of SSRIs:\nhttp:\/\/www.plosmedicine.org\/article\/info:doi\/10.1371\/journal...\nhttp:\/\/jama.jamanetwork.com\/article.aspx?articleid=185157\nEvidence of the non-publication of antidepressant trials:\nhttp:\/\/www.nejm.org\/doi\/full\/10.1056\/NEJMsa065779\nA good summary of the evidence against neurochemical hypotheses is Eero Castren's \"Is mood chemistry?\" (Nature Reviews Neuroscience 6, 241-246 (March 2005)), but even the most cursory search on pubmed paints a very clear picture."}

By observing that the longer sequences will skip more items than the shorter sequences, I wrote a 2-level loop that skips over items in the longer sequence before performing comparisons with the shorter sequence. That got me roughly a 2x performance advantage over the STL variant.\nLet's call this apples.

{"prompt":"The iPhone has remained virtually unchanged over the last 5 years. Each model is slightly faster and slightly brighter. Sure you fanboys can make the argument about every feature added, but look at the specs differences. And the look and feel of the phone has barely changed[1].\nIf you look at the progress not just in design, but software, hardware and everything. Samsung, HTC, Nokia, all the major manfs have come miles further than Apple in the last 5 years when it comes to hardware design.\nWhen it comes to software Android has also come miles in the last few years. People that aren't Android users don't realize this and go with the same standby arguments against Android (fragmented, ugly ui, non-integrated UI). When Android first came on the market (HTC G1) it could not even compare to an iPhone. But Android has solved many of these problems over the years, due partially to the fact that it's open source and has lots of people \/ companies contributing to it. It has now come to a point where it is miles beyond iOS and iOS has even gone as far as starting to steal features from Android (notifications drawer anyone?).\nI've said it before I will say it again. Apple should spend less money worrying about and suing it's competitors and spend more time and money on improving their mediocre products.\nThe time for something new from Apple is definitely soon or they risk starting to lose market share.

Would you say a stock portfolio changed \"slightly\" if it quadrupled in 5 years?\nThe form factor and design is branding. You might as well say \"Porsche has barely changed their form factor in 40 years\". The point is to be recognizable, not to arbitrarily change a design. And for a human-interacting product, our hands didn't change much in 5 years, so the \"ideal\" handheld device shape probably wouldn't change much either (if it does, it likely means we didn't look hard enough the first time around)."}

{"prompt":"I don't exactly want to hijack the thread, but let me present an idea of how one could burn $1,000 if one wanted to do it for promotion.\nStep 1: Install Wordpress.  Good, already done.\nStep 2: Create a big ol' list of keywords which you think are relevant to your business.  For example, [sign contract online], [sign document online], [sign contract with iPhone], [sign contract with Blackberry], etc etc.  This doesn't cost anything more than your time.\nStep 3: Design a template which, given a particular keyword, includes a few hundred words of content about the keyword and also acts as a landing page for your service.  I'm assuming this is effectively free for most of us on HN.  The last time I did it it required copy\/pasting one file in Wordpress and then five minutes of hacking the PHP to do what I wanted it to do.\nStep 4: Write between 50 and 100 of these, depending on how you get them done.  This is what costs the $1,000, since you're probably going to zone out after doing this five times, write up the process, and then hire the rest out to freelancers.\nPredicted results: on average, depending on query volumes, you're going to pick up a handful of hits for each page every month for life.  So instead of having 1,400 clicks once, you'll get somewhere on the order of 400 clicks a month for forever.  And instead of them being someone who was just gawking at a pretty girl in Chemistry class or poking their sheep while farming virtual cabbage, it will be someone who is right now trying to solve a problem which is costing their business money.\nAnd if you have $2,000 to spend?

Can I make it myself?\"\nI think its something hackers, especially those with children should ask themselves: Would I still be me, if I had grown up around primarily content consumption computing devices instead of more general purpose laptops and desktops?\nTablets are knocking the sales off of low-end PCs, but we as a society need the cheap PC to remain viable, if we want to turn as many children as possible into creators, engineers, tinkerers, and hackers.","completion":"This is a common generational worry, right? We learned X a certain way, that pedagogy was necessarily linked to the technology at the time, we worry in retrospect that that specific technology was a necessary condition for ever learning X.\nI'm only 28, and I do it, too-- e.g., how will kids expand their imagination and learn about the world without only having paper books to immerse themselves in for hours at a time? How will anyone learn the basics of programming without finding QuickBASIC on an old Packard-Bell 386, playing around with Gorillas or Snakes, or entering their own code from books in the library?\nI think there will be a sufficient number of hacker types around for the cynical and simple reason that corporations need to inspire kids to learn how to code so that they can hire folks in two decades. This ought to inspire a token amount of educational support and tool building so that entry-level development will always be accessible to kids."}

{"prompt":"A lot of the points can be boiled down to \"work very hard\".  But what if you simply are the type of person who doesn't like working?  Another point is do what makes you happy.  For some lucky folks, work makes them happy, but there's a lot of us who don't like it.  And no, it's not just a specific job.  A lot of us are just kinda lazy to be perfectly honest.  The things I enjoy most are running, eating fine meals, quality times having beers with friends, traveling, reading and playing video games.  I do work so I can support myself so that I can do those other things, but I certainly wouldn't work if I didn't have to (and I've worked and saved long enough that I'm fairly wealthy and won't have to for very much longer).\nI think one of the reasons is that I don't care about social status or material possessions or competing at who can make the best chat app or anything like that, and work just feels like a grind to me.  Sure, some of it is better than other parts, but in the end, I'd always rather be doing something else.  I also am not usually impressed with other peoples' career achievements, and getting a promotion or a better job doesn't give me any sort of feeling of accomplishment or 'high', just, well I guess I'm a few years closer to being wealthy enough to get out of this bullshit.\nA lot of people will look down on me for this, but I'm ok with that as I'm not trying to win a popularity contest.  I just don't think \"work hard\" is necessarily the best advice to all people.  I do think work is important as it's a means of contributing to society, and in the end, I'm glad I did my part, but after I have enough to \"get out\", I'll have satisfied my conscience to spend the rest of my days having good times and doing things that really make me happy.","completion":"I think the difference between you and the people that want to work hard to \"make the best chat app\" is that the sense of fulfillment and the concept of living a good life between you and this group comes from two different things. For you it's just being happy by being with friends and family etc while for others its accomplishing something they truly believe in whether it's some college kid trying to make the next chat app or Elon Musk trying to make humanity an interplanetary specie. That sense of fulfillment is attained from different things - and that's ok. Everyone has their things that make them feel fulfilled, and they are not always the same. You just have to be honest with yourself to know what that is."}

But as I kept saying ever since Snowden's leaks happened - the US government fucked things up, they won't even admit to how badly they fucked up and this will have deep repercussions internationally regarding the future of the Internet. A lot of international (mostly US) companies will get hurt by this, because (1) they didn't have a saying in the matter, yet the public views them as being guilty nonetheless and (2) because of balkanization.\nAnd the US can't point fingers and say \"look who's talking\", as that won't achieve anything. Say that to the Russian public who approves this. The US, as the stewart of the Internet, should have been careful to not fuck things up so badly in the first place. And after Snowden's leaks I would have liked to see some apologies, some heads falling - but ALAS, no, nothing of the sort - only a direct confirmation that they don't care about the rights of foreign individuals and as a non-US citizen, how do you think that makes me feel?","completion":"Acquiescence is not acceptance."}

He told me not a single investor had followed up with him about a term sheet despite multiple discussions after the pitch. Another friend in CO is in the same boat, being revenue positive but with no interest from angels or anyone else.\nI think stating that anyone can get money is a dangerous thing to say because it gives the wrong impression about availability of dollars.

I worry about my kids, and my wife, and my ageing parents. I'm sleeping constantly, but when I sleep my dreams are too vivid.\nDespite it all, I'm a functioning human being. I function at work so I use this to distract myself. It's a fairly dull job at the moment while I try to do a Computer Science degree. But I've had to defer it due to family pressures and because of this blasted funk. I intended to study in my own time, especially mathematics, but I just can't get enough motivation to do it now.

After time t, the most desired deals r in resource R are exhausted, leaving behind lesser deals (deals which make substantially less revenue-share). So as t >> T, only less desired deals remain for market X, hugely eroding profits margins, given the high fixed cost to set the deal. So the only way to maintain margins is to enter a new market Y, where r (very profitable daily deals) is in high supply. But eventually this market will be exhausted of r, and margins will again collapse. Therefore Groupon must continually enter new markets to maintain margins, which it has been doing. But there are only a finite number of markets. So eventually Groupon will collapse. This is an intrinsic problem of the daily deals market.

{"prompt":"There is absolutely zero reason why HR\/recruiting people should have final say on a candidate. None. It should be inconceivable, at a technical company, to hand over that much hiring power to a non-technical person.\nHR people are valuable in a company. But their role is to get resumes in front of the real decision makers, and to take care of all the stuff like W-2 forms and whatnot nobody wants to deal with, not make decisions about who to hire.\nIt seems weird to me that so many tech companies have adopted this particular Big Corp characteristic, because it's certainly not a universal phenomenon. A tech company is not Wal-Mart. Its hiring process should not be structured like Wal-Mart. People are the lifeblood of a technical company. Tech companies should not therefore look to Big Corps who just hire large amounts of unskilled labor. They should look, instead, at how hiring is done at a consulting company or an investment bank, companies that are also reliant on skilled people as their most important asset. At those places, from your screening interview forward, you are only evaluated by someone on the business side of things. It might be a junior analyst or a senior managing director,[1] but it's someone who does the work that makes the business money. HR's job is to get good candidates in front of those people.\nAt least in my experience, start-ups and very small tech companies do this right, out of necessity. Where I used to work, interviews would involve talking with a few line engineers, then the VP of Engineering, then briefly the CEO (who was a technical person). I think as companies get bigger, they feel like they need to adopt the Big Corp model. But this start-up model of hiring scales just fine to companies of 500-1,000 technical people if you're willing to create a culture where everyone, especially the top technical leadership, is personally invested in hiring and devotes a reasonable amount of time to evaluating people.\n[1] Anecdote: I once had a screening interview conducted by the managing partner of the D.C. office of a major law firm.

I think a big reason why people don't encrypt mail, etc., is because:\n1) they don't know why it's important because nobody can explain it to them in relatable terms (like saying: when you send an email, Google keeps a copy forever, and the FBI can read it just by picking up a phone and asking nicely), and\n2) if they do know the importance, the practicalities of encryption are explained impenetrably.  A blur of acronyms, bad metaphors (\"keys?\" terrible choice of metaphor, considering how a pair is intertwined and their actual use), and no well-known authority you can trust to explain it all simply.\nThe problem isn't that people don't care.  They would care if they knew the realities of how their communications are stored, processed, and exposed to their governments.

What happened?\nWell, the mercantilist economic toolkit has an endgame.  Neither Sam nor I knows when it's going to let them down, but building an entire economy on cheap labor and radical amounts of investment is hard to sustain.

And even then, at least some examples from the docs might be to trivial to protect (you won't succeed claiming to own the code snippet \"list = [1,2,3]\" or similar).

{"prompt":"The problem I have is that I can't really imagine the catalog subscription model to be feasible if any and all catalog entries were available to download without DRM. Someone with a fat pipe could just spend a month downloading absolutely everything, cutting the subscription and enjoying the goods for a long time to come, whereas the idea is that the user remains as a subscriber because of the limited time they have for consuming all the content.\nAnd while DRM is generally very inconvenient, there are also places where it's mostly \"invisible\" - Spotify and Netflix are pretty damn convenient on the whole, with pretty much the only major downside being the inability to watch stuff without an internet connection (though Spotify offers limited offline downloads for this reason too). The DRM in Steam is also generally quite invisible to the end-users, which is why people generally do not mind it - and also because Steam offers a lot more convenience with its service than what it takes away with its DRM.\nAs I said, ideally I'd like to see digital stores that combine the catalog subscription model as well as individual DRM-free purchases. Think Netflix, except you could also buy the really good stuff that you like. This would allow you to download DRM-free copies in many formats whenever you want, they could also bundle purchases with stuff like extras, and best of all: since they have a streaming infrastructure in place already they could also offer unlimited streaming for bought titles, even if you don't have a subscription. I imagine it would make for quite the killer service. But if everything could be downloaded DRM-free with just the catalog subscription, the individual sales would not work, and subscriptions would probably have a terrible retention rate.\nAgain, I just can't see the catalog subscription model working without at least some sort of \"download prevention\". I guess the biggest question is: Can we achieve that without the need for heavyweight black-box DRM schemes? I mean, you'd really just need to stop \"casual\" downloading - pirates will always find a way around protections, so they can't be stopped, but you'd just have to make sure a regular customer sees value in both the catalog subscription (which would be essentially renting) and individual title purchasing (actual buying).","completion":"I buy music on bandcamp all the time, yet I could pirate it.

If you have an algorithm with complex control flow (e.g. ray tracing, most problems in science) you will have to code really hard to achieve even 50% of peak. You can usually do something with an algorithm which is good for GPU but not optimal overall. So you have 30x speedup on GPU compared to CPUs but the scaling of this algorithm is worse then its more complex variant on CPU (e.g. O(n) vs O(log(n))). In the end many of these speedups are just marketing.\nMoreover GPUs have problems with double precision floating point numbers which are a must for most scientific problems (though sometimes you can utilize mixed precision approaches -> estimate in single precision, then get a correction in double).\nAnother problem is having ECC (error correction).

Apparently, some of these bugs are listed for sale at exorbitant price with no anticipation of ever selling them. They're not listed at close to a clearing price, but rather just aspirationally, with the idea being that anyone who will someday, maybe, engage a serious zero-day broker for a Netgear vuln is probably going to derive six figures of income from that bug.\nThat's the theory, at least.\nFor future HN bug bounty\/black market threads: note the absence of Facebook XSS vulns on these price lists.

I don't know any other projects that do what NaCl does, so regardless of whether Google should switch to pure NaCl for sandboxing, if they did, it would be innovation, not scrapping an antiquated technology.\nAs for whether they should - although Native Client's software fault isolation can provide better latency than hardware-based solutions because there's no need for a context switch, it takes a hit in throughput (7% overhead) because of the code contortions involved (though being able to trust the executable code might improve things).  There would be significant issues with supporting JIT in such a model, because JITs typically like to have rwx memory.  Multiple sandboxes in the same process wouldn't work with the current NaCl model on 32-bit platforms.  And although the SFI has been well secured, putting user code in the same address space as the master process might make exploitation easier - this would be partially mitigated if the address of the user code could be hidden from it, but doing that would require additional overhead because addresses could no longer be stored directly on the stack.","completion":"> The claim that process isolation is \"antiquated\" is absurd\nEither this is hyperbole, or it means the author is aware of research or a technology that the tech mainstream is unaware of."}

{"prompt":"OFF-TOPIC FOR ENGLISH-AS-SECOND-LANGUAGE:\nFor HN'ers who are still learning the finer points of English this title shows one of the many weird inconsistencies of the language.\nNormally, when trying to say 'a thing' where the thing starts with a vowel we change the 'a' into 'an' so 'a axe' becomes 'an axe', 'a umbrella' becomes 'an umbrella'.\nHowever this is a notable exception: when pronouncing 'user' there is an unwritten 'y' e.g. it is said 'yoozer', thus we wouldn't normally add another consonant here so it should be 'a user' not 'an user'. If you say it out loud you can hear it (and hopefully feel the extra tongue work that, traditionally, we try to avoid).\nAnother common exception is 'Hotel'. It takes 'an' rather than the expected 'a' as for some reason we drop the 'H'. For me it rolls better off the tongue with 'an' but this may purely be due to conditioning.\n'Herb' is a difficult one as in the US it's pronounced 'erb' while in the UK it has a hard 'H'. Thus in the UK we use 'A herb' \u2014 I assume the US says 'an Herb' \u2014 correct me if I'm wrong.\nIt's nonsense like this that makes me pity you brave fellows who attempt to master our pidgin of a language!\nEdit: change 'pigeon' to 'pidgin' :)","completion":"This is not actually an inconsistency. \"an\" is used when the next word starts with a vowel phonetically, not when orthographically."}

Yes, the startup cost is high, but it seems like it'd be offset by the decline in fighting lawsuits.\nhttp:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2013\/08\/14\/nyregion\/order-that-police...\n> But when Judge Shira A. Scheindlin, of Federal District Court in Manhattan, ruled on Monday that the city\u2019s stop-and-frisk program was unconstitutional and ordered that police officers in certain precincts strap tiny cameras to their uniforms to record their dealings with the public, Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s response was immediate and emphatic.\n> \n> \u201cIt would be a nightmare,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can\u2019t have your cameraman follow you around and film things without people questioning whether they deliberately chose an angle, whether they got the whole picture in.\u201d\nUm, just like you can't have cops carry guns because you'll have people questioning whether they were right to shoot and kill someone?

{"prompt":"I'm sure this will get down voted but why, in the last 30 years, have we needed the National Endowment for the Arts at all?\nArt is massively funded. The Motion Picture Arts, The Musical Arts, The Art of Literature, The Art of Architecture, The Popular Arts (as San Diego calls comics and graphic novels), The Video Game Arts\nKickstarter will help fund more art. That's great. I doubt it will get rid of NEA. The NEA is about funding things nobody wants. If people wanted them they'd already fund them directly.","completion":"Art may be massively funded, but I generally evaluate art based on two criteria:\n- Skill (how much skill did it take to produce?)\n- Expressiveness (how well does it convey something or evoke emotions?)\nNeither of those criteria will necessarily make something popular, which is why I think a completely crowdsourced approach to funding art may not give us the best results.\nNot to say that the NEA is the best solution by any means, but I do think there is some value to funding art that \"nobody wants\" because that is the same art that has the potential to be priceless in the future.\nAdditionally, art is very different from business. The quality\/originality of the work and its popularity\/commercial success are almost completely unrelated. You just have to look at the same industries you pointed out earlier. How many of the works of art those industries produced were made for the purpose of capitalizing on an opportunity to make money? How many were made to be truly expressive of ideas?"}
{"prompt":"It is truly painful to read some of the misinformed posts on economic issues here.\nHere is all you need to know:\n- Gold is money, and has been considered money by all civilizations on earth for thousands of years.\n- Gold does not decay, rust, degrade, or decompose in any way over time.\n- Gold cannot be printed, duplicated, or fabricated in any way.\n- Gold, because of it's unique color and atomic weight is almost impossible to imitate.\nGold is real money that holds it's value over time.  It is not in a bubble.  What is happening is that the bubble of fiat currency is deflating against gold.  Gold holds it's value in a remarkable manner over time.  You will find, for example, that a fine tailored men's suit has cost about one ounce of gold for hundreds of years.\nWhen you figure out the fiat currency is the real \"stupid\" you will probably wish you had some gold.

{"prompt":"Nexus One. I'm surprised you're even asking. Fully Linux-friendly, hackable, powerful and doesn't have any crapware from carriers or hardware manufacturers. Buy it at full price and sign up for a $59\/mo month-to-month plan from T-Mobile. Enjoy built-in tethering and guaranteed upgrade to the latest version of Android.\nI own N1 and iPhone 4 and I believe that N1 is a superior phone. It doesn't need to be plugged to a computer for everything and as a phone it works much better on TMobile than iPhone does on AT&T: the reception is worse on the iPhone, it wouldn't accept MMS or SMS with non-English characters in 2010. WTF. The software (Android) is totally in a different league too: integration with Google calendars, maps and contacts is truly amazing, and you quickly get used to your phone automatically recognizing phone numbers and addresses in arbitrary text.\nAnother huge thing is Google Voice: you can dial any number straight from your address book without even worrying which country you're calling to, that's mind blowing to me (and I use it daily).\nI bought both because we're doing software development for both, but I'm not proficient enough to comment on their APIs and programming environments. I do prefer Objective-C to Java though","completion":"Another huge thing is Google Voice\nI don't use Google Voice for outbound calls, but I absolutely love the voicemail features from Google Voice.  I thought that visual voicemail on the iPhone was nice, but after switching to Android I realized the combination of the web interface and the onboard voicemail app on the phone is a huge winner.\nAlso, to address the OP's concern about staying on AT&T, my AT&T band N1 seems to work like a champ.

{"prompt":"I'm surprised this actually made it to HN.\nI've read Barry's blog and have met him in person. He's one of the brightest, most realistic financial commentators out there.\nWe've seen an increase in media politicizing market movement. The example he cites was Obama coming out and making comments about financial regulation, and then the market takes a dump.\nSo you'll see on Marketwatch, Y! Finance, Motley Fool and others about how the president's comments caused the market to drop. This is rubbish.\nShort term noise in the market happens. We were due for a pullback and this, combined with Greek CDS spreads and China's rates, prompted some weakness.\nThe same thing happened during the inauguration, how the market flew further south. And then the pundits came out and proclaimed how the new administration would be terrible for equities-- and then we rallied. A lot. And those pundits who thought there was some correlation between politics and markets disappeared.\nSame thing here. The WSJ has increased it's politicization of it's content, when it has been known for the best financial news source out there. It may sell more papers, but they are significantly compromising the intellectual integrity of the staff and the brand.","completion":"Without RTA, I don't think I agree with your comment. For two reasons.\nFirst, markets move on information. Maybe one piece of big, important information, like a war, or more generally millions of bits of information. But it is a reasonable observation to note the correlation between big news stories and market moves.\nSecond, most times markets don't move on big news. In that case, the trend that I've seen for over a decade is for people to simply speculate on why the market moved one way or another for a particular day. It's not science, it's not news -- it's informed speculation, or entertainment.\nI think serious investors let this type of entertainment roll off of them -- after all, people like to chat, and media forums like the WSJ (or HN) provide them a forum to do so.\nSeparating the noise from the signal is the entire purpose of becoming a good investor. Thinking it's all signal or all noise is a good way to never be one."}
{"prompt":"At first I thought \"oh no, another distraction for Mozilla\", but then I sat through the presentation and thought there was some really cool ideas (amazebar!).

Even better, some of the assumptions here even make the software portable (as in doesn't really need to be installed and could just run off a usb drive\/out of my dropbox).\nAutomatically being in a private\/secure mode makes lots of sense to me as well.\nSome ideas I don't like:\n- get rid of loved sites\/bookmarks altogether. Frequent usage should just percolate autocomplete suggestions to the top. This design doesn't really need them, and tbh I've barely used bookmarks in any browser in a long time.\n- too much going on in the amazebar, drop all the suggestion (which will quickly get stale, tabs, email search, etc. Just focus on most frequent sites and autocomplete, it feels like the presentation is just burying lots of the clutter that used to take up GUI space in the amazebar.\n- please don't default to a \"downloads\" folder. I've never liked it and before I bother to change it, my downloads folder quickly turns into a \"random junk I've downloaded\" folder.

{"prompt":"The practice of tipping services a bunch of business purposes:\n* It creates a spectrum of competition for server spots; service staff at fine dining restaurants make significant amounts of money but must hustle to secure those jobs; service staff at diners make reliable but low amounts of money and can easily find work.\n* It functions as a commission system; servers who sell higher-priced products get superior returns from those tables, which suits the aims of the restaurant itself. Servers who can move wine make significantly more than servers who can't, and in good restaurants, wine is where the restaurant makes its money.\n* It obviously helps ensure that servers are polite and helpful, which, restaurants being in the hospitality industry, is obviously a core part of the value proposition.\n* More importantly, it incentivizes servers to increase table turnover.\nThese are all functions that could be managed at varying levels of effectiveness by other compensation schemes, but those other schemes don't actually improve outcomes for consumers; they raise prices and reduce transparency.","completion":"I'm not interested in encouraging up-selling or table turnover, so you're saying I should not tip?"}
{"prompt":"> ...there has been a virtuous cycle between software and hardware development. CPU hardware improves, which enables faster software to be written, which in turn...\nThis is the exact opposite of the experience I've had with (most) software. A new CPU with a higher clock speed makes existing software faster, but most new software written for the new CPU will burn all of the extra CPU cycles on more layers of abstraction or poorly written code until it runs at the same speed that old code ran on the old CPU. I'm impressed that hardware designers and compiler authors can do their jobs well enough to make this sort of bloated software (e.g. multiple gigabytes for a word processor or image editor) succeed in spite of itself.\nThere are of course CPU advancements that make a huge performance difference when used properly (e.g. SSE, multiple cores in consumer machines) and some applications will use them to great effect, but these seem to be few and far between.","completion":"I know it's a common complaint amongst a certain set to remember some bizarre version of the good old days when software was lean and mean and usable and did all the work our modern software does, but that time literally never existed. What you call bloat, most people either call \"usability and features\" or simply don't notice at all. The fact that you (apparently) don't like usability and features and prefer to call them bloat doesn't actually give any veracity to your opinions - certainly not enough to make such assertive unsupported statements."}
{"prompt":"Is there an element of exploitation here from the media? It looks like Leo was on the Today show.

I guess the system got what it wanted: the Today show got its feel good story for overfed housewives and Today show advertisers got the eyeballs they wanted. Larger, more important, narratives were conveniently ignored.\nMeanwhile, the larger narrative on how the US's private healthcare system means huge barriers to entry and especially for mental health issues, gets swept under the rug.  Leo doesn't want a bank account for non-rational reasons. A little money and fame aren't going to change that.  The whole article seems to skirt around the obvious mental health issues here. Its just incredible we can just pretend they don't exist and come up with ham-handed rationalizations on why Leo doesn't want a bank account.

Today, that social surveillance network still exists (tips given to police, etc.) but in a degraded form now that people live more individually.\nPeople instinctively dislike spying because they want to be in control of their own PR (social status), and secrecy gives them advantage even while it hurts society as a whole due to information asymmetries.  Gossip networks tend to distort the true picture as well.  This, humans evolved to protect their own secrets while simultaneously snooping and gossiping on their neighbors.\nHowever, living in an organized society involves compromise for the greater good, and community surveillance is one of those compromises.

Hence, it is the case either that if John is in Paris he is in England, or that if he is in London he is in France.\"\nmakes no intuitive sense.

{"prompt":"Samsung DID straight up copy Apple. Apple isn't going after other manufacturers, just this specific one for these specific devices. Here's a little side-by-side comparison of what Samsung did: http:\/\/atomicsupersky.com\/post\/26275796849\/on-the-samsung-ga...\nThis all could have been avoided if Samsung didn't blatantly copy Apple. I mean, they even copied the same color for the phone icon. If you go into Photoshop and compare the two greens, they are identical. You don't accidentally do that. Samsung had the intent to copy. It isn't even about the under-the-hood aspects (which can be another discussion,) this is about the clear and obvious ripoff of Apple design.\nSamsung did this to themselves. The point of this injunction is that consumers could be confused. After all, even Samsung's own lawyers couldn't distinguish the Galaxy from the iPad at a distance of 10 feet.","completion":"It's easy to see that they copied on the software side, but there are only so many ways you can distinguish a flat rectangle while making it useful for its intended function.

{"prompt":"This is dumb. The fact that one pixel subtends a particular visual angle does not imply that N pixels subtend N times that angle. It should be very plain to anybody implementing or using a rendering engine that pixels are intended to be linearly additive. This implies that N pixels will subtend less than N times the angle one pixel subtends. On a flat screen, this is normal and expected, because a pixel further from the eye will subtend less angle than a pixel closer to the eye.","completion":"You're right: this implies that a browser needs to render pixels at the edges of the screen differently than the ones in the middle to fully conform to the spec, particularly very wide (e.g. 30\") displays and\/or when your face is very close to the screen."}

{"prompt":"Checks are typically very simple, no regex-ing involved.\nFirst, names are not really checked.\nFor addresses, usually only the number (and sometimes just first three digits) are checked as well as the zip.\nGenerally the processor tries to decline as few txns as possible and instead deliver the information to the merchant to make a decision. The merchant can usually pre-configure error codes that it would like the processor to decline. This might be preferable to the merchant from a cost-saving standpoint as well as not needing to \"void an auth\" in order to free up the cardholders spendability.\nThe idea behind CVVs is that merchants are disallowed from storing them so they are far less likely to be included in stolen credit card databases. Thus, requiring them significantly decreases fraud risk. And, yes, many gateways\/processors charge more for missing or incorrect CVVs.\nIt's harder to \"steal\" a chip card since the information is not sitting on an easy-to-read mag-stripe. It's not clear that chip cards would have avoided the Target thing since the fraudsters infiltrated the terminal software. I'm guessing more current terminals\/software is simply harder to compromise. \"Chip & pin\", as is widely used in places such as Canada and Europe, might help a bit since you would need the PIN to shop off-line. But it would have minimal effect for online shopping since PIN is typically not requested.\nThe reason we still sign receipts and yes, you still see a carbon copy here and there, is mainly because it protects the merchant if the cardholder does a \"chargeback\". Merchants typically store the receipts and only turn them over if a chargeback is received. Showing the signed receipt to your processor will usually absolve you from any loss.\nI think the above is accurate or close to.","completion":"> charge more for missing or incorrect CVVs.\nWait, what? Can transactions still go through without the CVV, except the merchant's transaction fee is a bit higher? They're just not declined outright?"}

{"prompt":"It doesn't look as though the authors factored in any increased heating costs in wintertime.  Is this effect negligible?","completion":"Heat gain\/loss through the roof and other opaque parts of the building shouldn't be an issue because insulation is cheap and about 200mm of modern insulation is all you need before air tightness and AC efficiency become the major factors for energy loss. Also, cubicle farm style office buildings are typically in cooling mode, i.e. they are rejecting excess heat for at least 3\/4 of the year even in a temperate climate because of the heat generated by people, IT, lighting etc. Therefore reducing solar gain through windows is pretty critical to improving energy efficiency by reducing the load on the cooling systems. So using solar panels as part of a brise soleil to provide shading to windows would be the optimum solution but this is a more expensive facade structure to build and more expensive and less safe to maintain, so it's typically only done on high spec buildings which need some eco bling.\nResidential buildings have different factors in play. Residential efficiency is all about retaining as much heat as possible in winter through air tightness, winter solar gain through windows and insulation. With good insulation and solar shading, summer heat gains are not so much of an issue for residential in temperate climates; for example most people in Northern Europe don't have AC because there are only a few weeks of the year when you would have it switched on."}

As if it were designed, implemented, but never actually used before the release.\nWhen PS3 came out, it was excellent. It was an adult-oriented standalone console that worked well as a media center and it was also really well designed. It was true to the spirit of old Sony electronics - a self-sufficient device with a polished interface that matched its function. Sure it had a hook up to the Internet and PSN, but it was secondary. But then they started \"improving\" things. First, you got promo ads in the corner of the home screen. Never asked for a permission, no way to turn them off, even by disabling the network connection. So my device was little bit less mine. Then they started pushing \"selected apps\"- Netflix-Shmetflix and what not. Again, without asking, just because it was good for me, and, again, the device became even less mine. At the same time they increased the font size and replaced that beautiful Navier-Stokes visualization of a loading indicator with some generic spinner clock thingy. Sprinkled some other crap over the UI.\nJust now imagine your old Sony cassette deck deciding to show you ads for new Justin Bieber album and offering to share shit on Facebook. That's PS3 now.

And avoid a super competitive environment that gives you a negative feedback if you're giving 100% all the time.\nWould you agree?","completion":"As kayoone already said, people usually play games for fun. Knowing or realizing games have some benefit is a bonus.\nAs the effort\/exaustion part, people actually like that. In fact, the tiredness is mainly something people tolerate as a \"cost\" for all the \"fun\".\nWhen I play sports with friends I'm not doing it to be fit, I'm doing it for the social intercation, the friendly competition. I'll be tired and with some bruises, and will struggle to get off bed the next morning, but I feel it was worth it.\nAnother example, video game related. I like Dark Souls. But I kind of suck at it. During a more frustrating sessions, after some groans and curses my girlfriend naively asked me: \"If the game makes you so angry and frustrated, why do you keep playing it? Why don't you play another game?\". It made me think. I guess I like being challenged. And the harder and the more times I fall, the better is the feeling when I finally win. The more I shout and swear at the game, the bigger is the smile after beating a challenge (or the sigh of relief)."}

If that is true, and if, as many say, it is only a matter of time before \"software eats the world\", is there anything left that will be patentable?\nThe court decision this week seems to entangle two things; the fact that the abstract idea was not novel, and the fact that it was abstract. It is not clear to me: had the abstract idea itself been truly novel - would that have changed the outcome? A lot of people are saying this ruling is against patenting abstract ideas but it seems to me that it is mostly about the fact that directly transcribing an idea to a computer doesn't ADD concreteness (or novelty?), NOT a judgement about the veracity of the original idea.

{"prompt":"Saying \"Children aren't born smart\" is equivalent to saying \"Intelligence is determined entirely by one's environment\", if I understand the claim correctly. While I'm sure talking to ones children contributes in a massively positive way to their IQ, I think it's extremely inaccurate and ignorant to the existence of real-world outliers to claim that it's the only factor.\nTo provide just one example (out of many, I'm sure): I was born into a very poor (far below poverty level) working class family that was extremely techno-phobic. Despite being actively discouraged almost throughout my childhood of pursuing an intellectual career, I always had an intrinsic motivation and desire to learn and create tech-related things. This ultimately lead to where I am now, as a software engineer (and I'm definitely the only one like this from my family, a clear outlier).\nTo this day I can't come up with a single environmental influence that explains this -- and believe me, I've tried. I don't mean for this example to detract from the positive message of the article -- that talking to children is very beneficial to their cognitive development (obviously) -- but hopefully to demonstrate that it's a lot more complex than just environmental factors.","completion":"'I was disadvantaged ipso facto I am simply genetically gifted'.\nCould it, perhaps, be that those causal elements in your environment do not work precisely in the way you presume to work?

{"prompt":"Fine painters will almost never use black. The pigment in black paint is very deadening and harsh, it's difficult to work with. It's much better to take the time and create dark hues from the rest of the color wheel. A standard exercise in color theory classes is to create black from the primary colors. Most people end up with brown, but a beautiful, rich black and nearby shades can be accomplished, and it's worth the effort.\nIt's an entirely different ball game though when you switch from a subtractive color system (which is what painting is, the primaries being cyan, magenta and yellow) to an additive one (which a computer monitor is, with the primaries being the well known RGB). In an additive system dark hues are only accomplished by removing light instead of adding pigment, so the problems a painter faces with black don't exist quite in the same way. So comparing website\/app design to Monet is a tiny bit far fetched.\nIt seemed like a lifetime ago but I used to live and breath this stuff, even got a degree in painting. I guess it wasn't entirely useless :)","completion":"Digital paintings still shy away from #000000 black in paintings. It still often looks wrong. It'll flatten out just about anything you put it on.

Adding true black to your real life paintings has this huge possibility of totally blowing up any colours near it if it mixes in by mistake. Digital well... that's up to the artist's self imposed limitations.\nThat said, all the rules about black disappear once you talk about greyscale images.\nAs some sister comments point out, while the relationship between colours remain the same in RGB as pigment, the role the relationships and colours play are different from on a website, to print, to a painting.\nI also suspect that sub pixel rendering could screw around with off black fonts."}

Successful parents (who were likely encouraging, supportive, and open-minded), great schools, achievements at early ages, etc, all seem to be a common thread, and trying to kickstart things again past your formative years seems futile. I don't mean to rant or derail the topic, and apologies if I do.","completion":"I experienced a lot of the same stuff growing up.

{"prompt":"I stopped using Facebook last November.  It's been a fantastic experience.\nWhether you realize it or not, FB changes your emotional health. FB used to make me oddly depressed. Its like sitting in front of the TV and feasting on Sour Patch Kids for two hours.  I would sit there staring at how awesome people's lives were and wonder why I wasn't doing such awesome things myself.  I heard about the passing of family members from family friends before family members would have a chance to tell me personally.\nAfter I stopped going to FB my important friends started CALLING me. Can you believe that? They picked up the phone and CALLED me.  I went out to dinner more. I stopped engaging in those destructive conversations like \"Can you believe so-and-so's status message...\"\nThere have been some drawbacks though.  I don't always hear about last-minute parties. I don't get to see the pictures my friends take from events.  And I don't have the luxury of sending a message to someone I don't quite know very well who wouldn't have my phone number or e-mail, most likely through group activities like Crossfit that I'm a member of.\nBut all things considered, ditching Facebook is highly recommended.","completion":"I don't understand this at all.\nFB (and social media in general) is the only thing I've found that enables me to organize going out for drinks with more than 2 people at once.\nAlso the only thing that lets me post \"Hey, anyone wanna go out for ice cream tomorrow evening?\" and actually having 5 people come. Three of which are completely new outside twitter\/facebook.\nIt's really quite awesome.\nHell, I have very scatterbrained friends who are always busy with something. Without twitter, facebook and irc I'd never get to talk to them at all. Let alone be able to see them almost every other day like I do now.\nAnd that's not even accounting for the fact that some of us tend to leave the country for months at a time, but still wanting to keep in touch.\nSeriously though, how do you usefully and efficiently keep in touch with more than 1 person via telephone? I can't even imagine it working.\nOh and, word of advice from a \"silly 24 year old\". If looking at other people's lives makes you depressed, lead an awesomer life. Friends being better than you should be an encouragement to do better, not a depressor."}

{"prompt":"Laser printers are great for many things, but when you do need good colour prints of photos, etc., you can apply the same advice to inkjets and get good results.\nWe got an HP Photosmart 8250 or so 3-4 years back. IIRC it was pretty much the most expensive A4 inkjet from HP at the time, but even that was only 2-3x as much as a mid-grade consumer printer. In any case, unlike most printers, it uses separate tanks for each colour of ink, and the print head isn't integrated into the cartridge. It makes a huge difference: the jets don't get blocked as they're designed to last. They also seem to be more precise, and you only replace the ink that's actually used up, and because the cartridges are \"dumb\", they're cheaper. Not quite cheap as such though, and bigger cartridges would be nice.\nAs for original manufacturer's ink vs third-party: in my experience, the HP stuff ages much better (especially when exposed to sunlight), everything else is probably subjective.","completion":"2.5 stars on Amazon with 48\/109 1 star ratings and 25\/109 5 stars."}

Facebook adds extreme value to your social life connects you with people that you don't see daily, lets you know about birthdays, events, comments and what not. It's excellent at what it does IMHO and if used properly is really what web-2.0 is all about. I can say that if Zuckerberg didn't invent Facebook in ~ 2004, it would have been invented by now, by someone else because that was what people needed badly to stay connected.\nFacebook is just a tool. If you are in the intel business or you are a possible target (e.g. prominent figure of some sort) and fairly young to understand how the internet works, you use FB for PR and nothing else. Maybe not even that.\nEvery social network can be used for data mining from intelligence agencies. Do most people care? No. Why? Because they don't see any kind of real threat. It doesn't interfere with their lives. The HN crowd is composed mostly by hackers.

{"prompt":"Over the years, I've noticed that many programmers who want to re-write, just aren't comfortable modifying other people's code, or it wasn't written in their favorite language. So, they are critical of the code and urge for a re-write. These people generally make bad programmers. If you have people on your staff that want to re-write this program, or switch to this framework (because it's what they are used to), then watch out. That's a bad sign.\nCompetent programmers can maintain other people's code, those who cannot want to re-write everything. Train wreck in progress.

The SSDs mentioned in the article have a lifetime of 72 TB, which means you can write 20 GB daily for more than 10 years. Also, 72 TB is probably a pretty pessimistic estimate.\nThat being said, if you do anything I\/O-intensive (write-heavy databases, anything with lots of small write operations, ...), YMMV.

{"prompt":"The lesson, applicable to games, startups, governance, and indeed systems engineering in general, is that systems react. You can not look at an existing system, then say \"Ah, this system is doing X, so I shall do Y which will cause the result Z, and nothing else.\" In this case, you can't look at the D2 community, and say, \"Ah ha, I shall inject this system for extracting money, and therefore it shall be exactly like the original situation except I shall be making money.\" The system reacts.\nThis is truly one of the gaping holes in human cognition, this idea that a single participant in a larger system can make a change and then model the results of that change without accounting for the reactions of all the other actors. Especially when the participant in question is by far the largest participant.\nI actually disagree that the root problem is that they put \"profit over gameplay\". The root problem is that they made changes designed to create profit, but failed to correctly understand how the rest of the system would react. There probably is a way to \"monetize\" the Diablo community more successfully, but whatever that way is it's going to be something more subtle than the Auction House was.\nI'd suggest looking at how Valve has monetized the hell out of Team Fortress 2 if you're trying to find a positive example. It's mind boggling what they've pulled off there, and observe that, like I said, it's a great deal more subtle than \"let's just put up some payment gates!!1!\". MMORPGs also provide a variety of interesting compare & contrasts, especially with the recent successes of the free-to-play models to compare to the WoW subscription\/expansion model.","completion":"One has to wonder about the plans for Hearthstone (another F2P game from Blizzard).

So you need at least the ability to PWM that. Sure, I could probably build a little timer circuit to do that, but it would be convenient if I could just bit-bang a GPIO pin instead of building more hardware.\nFor driving a few dozen RGB LEDs with PWM to control brightness on each of the three channels, you're very quickly going to reach the limits of what you can do with a standard PIC.

We have made great scientific discoveries and have spent enormous amounts of energy in learning how the world works. But we have spent so little time on studying ourselves as to why we behave in certain way. All we have come up with so far are conflict inducing strategies like mindfulness.","completion":"What has happened to me the more I meditate is the discovery of these two basic ways of interacting with the world. The first stance feels very familiar, it is the me that spends most of its time:\n1) judging the present, e.g. \"How does the present moment live up to my expectations of it? How can I change the present moment to meet my goals or aversions?\";\n2) expecting the future, e.g. planning or fantasizing \"What will I do if X happens? I must have X by Y or I won't be happy.\";\n3) replaying episodes from the past, e.g. \"I wish I had\/hadn't done X. I wish Y had\/hadn't done X to me. When I had X I really felt great.\"\n4) reacting to and getting caught up in emotions - anger, fear, desire, aversion, etc.\nAfter meditating, a categorically different stance towards reality becomes available: that of non-judgmental pure awareness. That part of you that is the awareness before all the other stuff begins, the awareness from which all the other stuff emerges.\nOne way to tell the first stance from the second is the presence of judgement. If you're judging then you're not experiencing pure awareness. That's how you know that your experience, that of \"another overbearing character watching my every move and telling me what to do\" is not what people seek with meditation - it's merely another form that ego takes: judgement of oneself instead of judgement of others or of the present moment. That kind of duality is just the ego showing just one of its multitudes of forms.\nThe more you meditate, the more time you fall into nonjudgmental awareness of the present moment, and act from that perspective instead of the other ego-directed perspectives.\nThe great contemplative traditions have written extensively on these matters - the difficulty is finding a tradition or teacher that fits one's learning style and cultural context. I would not look to science for a fundamental understanding of these things, as these are subjective matters which science is ill-equipped to address (that's not to say science can show us the very real objective effects of the subject process of meditation)."}

{"prompt":"I'm one of the first paying customers of Pocket.\nAlas, their quality has been going down recently. The most important feature - keeping the location inside an article between app invocations, is not working. For long articles, if I stop in the middle and want to resume later, there's a 80% chance that Pocket will happily set me right in the beginning.\nBesides, their rendering for articles with code sucks, so I almost always use \"web view\", a decision Pocket also forgets every other time.\nSo I end up using Pocket as a convenient keyboard-shortcut to save articles, but on my phone actually open them into Chrome, which has no problem remembering the location in a tab.","completion":"Similar impressions here. My e-book reader (Kobo Aura) has a native feature for synchronization with a Pocket account, so I end up using Pocket as a glorified bookmarking (and content fetching) service."}
{"prompt":"Truth is, this service never quite delivered on their promise.  When my last two startups closed shop, it took shutdownify over 3 days to process the first one, and the second was still a full two days to get up and running.

I know you've just said that this is an attractive option where brandability isn't important, but I'm hoping you can discuss this just a little bit more.

(Hire some game programmers who have worked on console games! A 1st gen iPad has about 3x as much memory as a Wii.) But let's face it, that's not going to improve their bottom line, whereas telling everyone to buy a new iPad every 24 months is.\nStill, those 15+ million iPad1 owners aren't going to be all that pleased, especially those who paid through the nose for the 64GB model.

{"prompt":"This post takes the lead-in with the Felisa Wolfe-Simon \"Arsenic DNA\" paper. In recent times I remember this was one of the most Hyped-up papers something akin to the Cold fusion paper by Fleischmann and Pons.\nThe contrast in the public response to the two incidents is fascinating. While Cold-fusion became a career-ender for anybody associated with it and Fleischmann & Pons both suffered pretty much banishment, repeated experiments have shown that there is something funny going on with that particular mix of compounds (Heavy water, Palladium, Nickel etc) - excess heat.\nWith arsenic life however, follow-up experiments have proven that it was contamination that was a cause of the result. So there is NO ARSENIC based life. Yet the lead authors of pretty much a gigantic false claim -orchestrated shamelessly by NASA-  seem to be doing pretty well, dodging the basic questions with that most famous catch-all - more work is needed (hence more money should be sent my way) to prove the (bogus) claims made.","completion":"In the cold fusion debate we sometimes forget the theorists who argue `for` and `against` cold fusion in platonic terms - where it has yet to be completely disproved."}

{"prompt":"It's a form of civil disobedience, and hopefully people can organize legal and material support for those arrested.","completion":"I agree, but to go off topic a bit: judging by some of the responses to your comment, people seem to think that one of the criteria that an act has to meet in order to be legitimate civil disobedience is that it is followed by a passive acceptance of government punishment. Of course this is tautologically true depending on one's personal definition of civil disobedience, no true Scotsman and such, but would exclude a lot of history, such as the Underground Railroad.\nThe article did have a nice quote directed at that point of view, though:\n\"There may be many times when protestors choose to go to jail, as a way of continuing their protest, as a way of reminding their countrymen of injustice. But that is different than the notion that they must go to jail as part of a rule connected with civil disobedience. The key point is that the spirit of protest should be maintained all the way, whether it is done by remaining in jail, or by evading it. To accept jail penitently as an accession to 'the rules' is to switch suddenly to a spirit of subservience, to demean the seriousness of the protest...In particular, the neo-conservative insistence on a guilty plea should be eliminated.\" --Paul Flowers"}

Not as good as a Wacom sensor built into the display itself, but they are there to some degree.\nThe issue is the same on Android.

While this data is now Google's, I entered it, originally. What's more, if I would be adding it again, to OSM, I'd certainly enter the same data.\nI wonder what the legal perspective would be if everyone crawled \"their\" data (i.e. the data they personally entered) from Google maps and forwarded it to OSM.","completion":"Try http:\/\/open.mapquest.com\/\nIt's using OSM data and I'm using the search function the way you describe it."}

{"prompt":"Lot of comments on HN, Reddit, and elsewhere criticizing the title (\"what does the MBA thing have to do with anything?\", \"who cares if its an MBA?\", etc.), which I think is a little ironic because the overwhelming mentality on tech forums is that MBAs are idiots with more money than brains that get paid absurd amounts of money to play golf and talk about synergy who could never do what we do.\nI'm glad that more traditionally non-tech people are being exposed to the wonders of programming.

{"prompt":"I disagree. I think it's pretty clear that Google fiber is an attempt to create demand for faster residential connections and provide a model for ISPs to do it.\nIf Google wanted to come at Comcast, they'd be gearing up a lot faster than they are. At this point Google Fiber is mostly FttPR-Fiber to the Press Release. And also, I don't think any of the first several Google Fiber locations were even in Comcast territory. So far AT&T and TWC have been their competitors.\nThey want to create demand because Google loves remote computing and loves internet consumption.\nGoogle is providing a model for the ISPs by forcing local communities to deregulate their ISP franchising system. Before Google Fiber, each town or state would take a pound of flesh from the new company trying to lay down a network.

{"prompt":"Just looks like more JavaScript antipatterns, this time with some ES6 flavour.\nWe know how to \"solve\" the problem of encapsulation with JavaScript. It's not with closures, Symbols, or some other arbitrary hack.

You simply put a single or double underscore in front of the property name.\nI read what I thought was a clever anecdote by another developer the other day, that the underscore in \"obj._varname\" indicates \"here be dragons.\" It's an extremely simple idiom to teach new JavaScript developers.\nI get it, JavaScript is robust. So you can do fun things like this! These are great experiments. But really, what are you accomplishing? You've now just thrown in a closure and a bunch of lines of code (defining your symbols, etc.) that any developer new to your codebase is going to look at like \"... what the... what is going on here?\" You can solve the problem easily with one character.\nConsistency. Convention. Creating useful, easy-to-understand, repeatable idioms. That's what we should be focusing on.","completion":"Python has been doing this forever and it just works.

{"prompt":"I used to be strongly in the no-www camp for aesthetic reasons, but have since come around. There are legitimate reasons why having www (or any subdomain) is important in any large site.\nThe CNAME argument is obsolete since most DNS providers support ALIAS records now.\nThe static no-cookie argument doesn't really matter since you could always serve static content on a separate domain altogether (ex: fbcdn.net).\nHowever, if you want to run hosted services on subdomains, you run into an important security issue. For example, say you have Zendesk hosted on support.mysite.com. You don't want to leak session cookies from mysite.com to support.mysite.com. In most browsers, you can just specify the cookie domain and it will only be sent to the root domain. However, NO versions of IE respect this (even IE 10+) [1]. So your IE users will always leak session cookies to hosted services on subdomains. In any reasonably secure site, this is unacceptable (especially when you start using other hosted services for status.mysite.com, careers.mysite.com, etc etc).\nUnfortunately, this is pretty much impossible to work around, unless you want to ban IE users from using your site entirely.\nSolution: Just use www (or any other subdomain, if you want to be different) from the start, and save yourself the headache of migrating later.\n[1] http:\/\/blogs.msdn.com\/b\/ieinternals\/archive\/2009\/08\/20\/winin...","completion":"Leaking cookies to subdomains IS a problem, but it shouldn't be too big of a deal security-wise if they are encrypted (as they usually are)."}
{"prompt":"This article defines \"troll\" far too broadly, in including any non-practicing entity. The whole point of turning something into a property right is to be able to trade it, and have the new owners enforce the original rights. It's conceptually no different than someone who buys a farm, doesn't plant anything on it, but sues people who trespass through it. The law doesn't require you to do anything with your property rights.\nThere are practical reasons for this. My law school alma mater, Northwestern, developed and patented the drug that became Lyrica. They sold the patent rights for about $700 million. Northwestern was not going into the prescription drug business. That would be utterly ridiculous. Treating patents as a property right allowed them to take the invention and \"exit\" by selling it to someone else. All research universities use this technique heavily: Stanford, MIT, etc.\nNow, you may not agree that propertization is the right tool for inventions, but the fact remains that when you're discussing a property right it's irrelevant what someone trying to enforce that property right otherwise does with the property.\nIMO, \"trolling\" should be limited to those who assert frivolous or weak patents to get quick settlements, not people who try to enforce legitimate patents. This is completely orthogonal to what sort of bar you think there should be for legitimate patents, or whether there should even be patents, by the way.","completion":"You've answered your own question, Northwestern isn't a troll because they had no intention of holding a patent long term.\nActually, this isn't a good example, as a new drug is such an established item that it's not really a new invention as such, and there's no reason they couldn't just be copyrighted (with less term)."}

If you use a mobile-first design philosophy for the webapps then phones are not likely to be an issue.\nYes, there is still the issue of response time but no language works for everything. You have to accept certain limitations and make compromises.\nActually, I might no longer even use webapps.

And by examining the implications of mistakes you have a learning opportunity too. Note that Javascript has been following Python's lead in adding more functional features.\nThere is a general language evolution going on and Python is in the thick of it, maintaining compatibility with the old imperative style beloved of data crunching scientists along with the functional goodies that Haskell, Erlang and Scala focus on.

How can Nokia beat HTC or Motorola if they are essentially selling the same product?  Things like Zune Pass, Xbox integration, and potentially tight integration with Windows client\/server could be a big competitive advantage. These are things Nokia could not do on their own. Google isn't going to piss off Samsung\/HTC\/Motorola by playing favorites with Nokia either. Worst case is the partnership doesn't work out and 3 years from now Nokia is puking out Android handsets.

{"prompt":"This is very interesting (and as has been pointed out in other comments, not exactly a new idea). I think its proper application, though, is in a tool for practicing reading, not for actually reading tests.\nOne major thing this approach looses is the inherent non-linearity of text. If I miss a fact and want to back up a bit, or want to pause for a moment and think about something, I can (when reading) without even thinking about it. Even if this approach is faster overall, it makes reading more like listening to audio or watching a video; it's a big pain to rewind or pause.\nSecondly, this is actually slower than true speed reading or skimming because it forces you to read every word. Truly accomplished readers will often read material at a very superficial level, only dipping in and reading consistently when they encounter a novel concept. Essentially, they can use semantic compression to increase their reading speed by only bothering to read what they find to be relevant. This operates on every level, from the page to the chapter to the paragraph to the sentence. It isn't perfect, of course, but it's always possible to back up if one finds crucial information has been missed.\nFinally, even though this tool is truly excellent for breaking the subvocalization habit that hampers most slow readers, once you learn how to read without subvocalizing it becomes a bit redundant. For example, looking at Spritz, I cranked the speed to 500. It felt pretty good, like I was reading fast. Then I went and took a traditional reading speed test and clocked in at 700wpm, with 95% comprehension. So I'm not sure my overall speed is better with Spritz.\nThat said, I'll probably keep coming back to this or technologies like this, now that I'm aware of them. They seem a really good way to force oneself into the speed-reading mindset - I have a feeling that doing this for 60 seconds before a normal reading session would improve reading speed substantially.","completion":"I just did a random reading speed test and got 1640wpm with 90% comprehension, and I definitely do not read linearly -- it's hard to explain, but I often find that I scan far ahead and see the ends of sentences before their starting words, then wander around somewhat randomly in the middle of them. I'll notice typos and grammar errors several sentences or even a paragraph after where it occurs, probably meaning that I'm taking huge \"gulps\" of words and internally buffering it, then processing it very nonlinearly. I've never taken any courses on speed reading, but I guess I developed this habit from reading code (where a lot of the time is spent seeking). The Spritz experience was a little disorienting since I kept wanting to seek around in the text, and being linearly spoonfed it gave me the feeling of losing track of what I'd just \"read\"."}

Another fact: the climate changed long before humans were around to drive Escalades.\nThe AGW movement is nothing more than an anti-capitalist false flag with a professed desire for wealth redistribution. Al Gore, for example loves the environmental movement so much because he became a multi-billionaire as it's Chicken Little.

For a director, it might mean meeting an actress to star in a movie. For a businessperson it might mean getting a job at a friend's dad's company.\nThe central idea behind MOOCs is that education is expensive now. It isn't -- just go to the library and pick up a book. Completely free, and if you're disciplined enough, probably pretty close to a university quality education. I'll concede that this doesn't apply to hard science education where you need sophisticated labs, but it does apply to a lot of students' fields of study.\nWhen most people think \"education\", they aren't talking about learning, but the complete package of learning, social activities, and making connections. That is expensive. You need a nice campus with plenty of green space to lie about and play frisbee. You need a nice gym, a welcoming student center, and a nice dorm area for people to socialize.

It wasn't until Dub Reggae was developed in Jamaica that the producer became more of a creator than someone sitting back and making sure the track sounded good while the band played it. A music producer and a television producer had similar levels of creative control, for example. But when Dub was created, that all changed. The producer became the focus of the track, because dub is just basic reggae that's been re-sampled and bathed in reverb, with some cool space sound effects thrown in. In this paradigm, the producer was also the DJ, sometimes (like in King Tubby's case) running their own soundsystem. Dub created the framework by which hip-hop and EDM are created and performed. But that didn't happen until the late 1970s."}

{"prompt":"One of the most tragic ideas to evolve in this century is the idea of \"intellectual property\"--that you can own an idea for years, sometimes tens or hundreds of years.  That term covers things outside of copyright, like patents, but the damage the idea as a whole in its present incarnation does to our long-term culture is the same.\nIdeas are intangible, not property, and someone can think the same thing as you without ever having met you or heard of you.  A more accurate term than \"intellectual property\" would be a \"short, government-protected monopoly on an idea\".  But we call it property, and after many years of calling that, it insidiously starts seeming to us like real property, and not the temporary monopoly it really is.\nThere's room for short, temporary monopolies.  As the framers realized, copyright and patents are critical to fostering innovation and culture.   Unfortunately, \"short\" went from being a very reasonable few years, to a slightly less reasonable 20ish years, to now, where if you publish a work today the chances of it being available to the public within 150 years are slim.  Do a grandchild's grandchildren deserve to lord over something created by a dusty ancestor centuries ago?\nIn a strange and sad way, our IP regime today means that individual authors are unlikely to be remembered by history 100 years from now.  Look at Project Gutenberg or Wikiart: hundreds of people from all over the world volunteer to lovingly scan, transcribe, format, categorize, and distribute works from the last few centuries.  They do this because that work belongs to the public now, and their efforts keep the memories and impact of those works and authors alive.

{"prompt":"Couple of bits of advice to anyone doing this:\nFirstly get your own IPs from your local RIR. Have your co-lo provider publish your routes, but they will be YOUR IPs. if you co-lo provider sucks, you can move and keep your IP space. (This is vital for email, but I recommend it for everyone).\nSecondly buy a Out of Band Management card with your server (iDrac for Dell, iLO for HP, etc) these cost fairly little and will save you hours of access \/ remote hands. They will pay for themselves, you can even boot an ISO from your laptop over the internet. Get your co-lo provider to give you an extra uplink for this and give it a separate IP (use one of the providers range)\nThirdly consider Mission Critical support on the servers from a solid vendor (In australia I consider the enterprise vendors Dell, HP, IBM and Acer, and of those I will only use Dell or HP). 4 hour response means you don't need as much spare hardware, and you can have things fixed FAST. I have only lost 2 disks in a rack of servers over 4 years. Both had a replacement in place within 4 hours (once at 1am).\nFourthly look at a good Virtualization solution. We initially went oVirt (Open source version of Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization) but ended up migrating to VMWare. VMWare Essentials Plus costs us $15K for 3 years in extortionate australia prices and is worth every cent. It provides Backup (VMWare Data Protector), Failover, Virtual SAN, Live Migration and a heap of useful features that save huge amounts of time.\nFinally if your going to grow consider getting a rack (or half \/ third of a rack). This will likely give you unescorted access to the data centre, and is often not that much more then a few RU of servers (depending on the DC and racking availability).","completion":"\"if you co-lo provider sucks, you can move and keep your IP space. (This is vital for email, but I recommend it for everyone).\"\nWhy is this \"vital for email\"?\nI agree that obviously if you can you want your own space.\nBut if you are planning your move you can handle the new ip space by dns ttl.

And yes it is a huge pain to be avoided so I'm not disagreeing just wondering about the \"vital for email\"."}

Someone with more experience or a more proven record could certainly have \"no idea\" and be the type of person where if you stick them in a room with other skilled\/experienced people, things will happen.\nI know more than a few people where we could sit in a room and brainstorm some decent business ideas.  Maybe not even ones we want to work on, but a building full of these people, with ideas coming out of one room, being refined in another, maybe being executed in yet another?  I think that could lead to something."}

They are having trouble distributing learning material because they are not familiar with the file formats (and most of the students here are using windows, so compatibility is a problem).\nThere have also been problems with the personal storage spaces students have on the computer network, people are sometimes unable to log in or unable to access their files.  It's been a mess.\nI'm all for supporting ubuntu, in fact I've been using an ubuntu variant on my laptop for a few years now without any trouble, but using Ubuntu (or any other OS that isn't Windows or OS X) in a school environment just to cut costs is a recipe for disaster.","completion":"also, it doesn't save the school any money anyway since they have to hire Network Admins and other IT people with Linux experience"}

Many tech startups don't have time for that, the quality of your work can make or break a startup. Elite startups want \"ex-googlers\".\nSo if you want to get good, you need to work with people that are better than you, who have already learned from their mistakes so you don't have to. Find the strongest shop that will hire you. It will not be the best shop. It probably won't be an elite startup. But more mature companies can afford to pay for your learning curve. You also will probably make more money, enough to pay off your student debt and save up to bootstrap when you're more experienced.","completion":"If you work on a startup, almost by definition you'll be doing a lot of different stuff, and changing a lot of things.

MongoDB is the new MySQL; early on the scene and sexy, but at a real cost.

{"prompt":"The thing I find most interesting about this discussion is that we have not yet seen anyone from the US proudly claiming that by working harder they are more productive than the rest of us. I have seen similar conversations several times on various on-line forums in the past, and there was always a defensive\/proud mindset from a significant group, even as those of us outside the US wondered if they realised how much their employers were abusing them.\nSince the financial mess of the past couple of years showed that US productivity figures that seemed too good to be true really were just an illusion, I'm hoping that the mindset of the average US worker has become a bit more realistic and a bit less willing to accept (by international standards) abusively long hours and short vacations.

{"prompt":"Turns out people just wanted a more refined iPhone with 4G.\nWho would have thought?\nSeriously though, I remember naysayers about the iPod back when it was first released, bemoaning the interface, design, and pointing out dozens of other mp3 players with longer feature lists at better prices. Yet the iPod still won out because it offered a consistent and predictable user experience, from the purchase to the day-to-day use\u2014looking at the quality of experience holistically and end-to-end, including fashion, features, and fun.\nYou could pick up any iPod and know how to use it, and that trend continued throughout new releases and new iPods for years on end, with the only major interface change being the shift to touch, which was (arguably) even easier to use.\nThe tech crowd tends to look at devices as bricks with feature lists attached to them, but consumers don't. And consumers are the ones who buy things and use them, not just us. The iPhone 5 is exactly what people want with just enough \"new\" to make them want it. It will be moderately successful for a refresh, and most importantly, people will continue to enjoy using their phones and will continue to want to upgrade in the future. Apple nailed it.","completion":"Yep, people buy benefits, not features.\nBut getting greater CPU power than, and equivalent GPU power to the iPad 3, into a tiny, smaller, lighter phone, is a pretty impressive feature.  Because the CPU power isn't spread over 4 cores, it's easier to utilise than Tegra 3 phones.  And... 2x in a year even beats Moore's Law."}

To associate them with negative judgmental phrases (such that we might easily use with anybody else in the world we meet) causes us distress.\nAnd from what I understand, Einstein chased women all his life, even during his second marriage. How he and his second wife got along with this is anybody's guess.\nBut to focus on Einstein or his faults (or my easy judgement of him) is to miss the point. We read this list and we feel disjointed -- cognitive dissonance. How can such a great man speak like this to one who loves him? The reaction shouldn't be to start naval-gazing at our on judgment of others. The reaction should be to realize that we have only a very simple and cartoonish view of the world. People who did a lot of good in the world had some really big flaws. People who did a lot of evil in the world had redeeming qualities. If we really want to understand these folks, we need to see them in their own terms, not how mass media portrays them.\nPerhaps some folks want to canonize some and demonize others. I much prefer to live in a world full of folks just like me -- human. The more I start glossing over faults? The more I'm missing out on all the good parts of history.\nLook. Einstein was a womanizer. Galileo was a bit of a jerk. Newton was unhealthily obsesses with numbers. Martin Luther King Jr also chased women. Hell Nash was officially certifiable. If the only thing you get out of all my statements is that I'm judgmental, you're missing the point. Worse yet your'e missing all the good stuff, the parts of history people don't talk about.

{"prompt":"> Curious to hear more about language-specific (though OS-agnostic!) package management systems.\nAs far as I can tell, one of the main justifications for most language package management systems is \"we also run on Windows\/OSX, which has no package management, so we'll invent our own\".  As a result, users of systems that do have sane package management get stuck with multiple package management systems, one for the distro and one for every language.  Even then, I find it disappointing that nobody has built a cross-platform package management system for arbitrary languages to unify those efforts.","completion":"The distro only contains a small selection of the packages (even if there are hundreds or thousands of them) and the language package system is usually the source the distro maintainers use to find the packages anyway."}

{"prompt":"While I usually agree with your advice, I think this approach, while theoretically correct, is actually damaging to the majority of your audience here. The closest analogy I can think of is that it's like requiring users to change passwords every 30 days: great in theory, but in practice it's a disaster.\nThe problem is that it is simply untenable for all but the highest-profile sites. Finding good ops people, even in the bay area, is extremely hard. Most sites are only going to realize that a security update has been released when their package manager tells them it has, and updating that package is usually a 30s process.\nThe companies I've seen have a hard enough time keeping track of security updates with package management. For a small to medium team with two, one, or even zero dedicated ops people, asking them to custom-compile (for example) a webserver, ruby implementation, and other critical libraries (openssl, glibc, etc.), subscribe to the relevant security mailing lists, and follow along with updates and security patches is tantamount to having them leave unpatched vulnerabilities on their systems for months or even years.\nIf you ask your users to change passwords every 30 days, there are inevitably going to be a few who take it seriously and generate and remember secure passwords every single time. But the vast majority are going to use weaker passwords than they otherwise would have, and duplicate those passwords across accounts as much as they can figure out how. Likewise, if you ask already overworked ops guys to manually compile and keep track of security vulnerabilities for their webserver and dozens of libraries, a few are inevitably going to keep on top of things and release fixes minutes after vulnerabilities are announced. But the vast majority are going to simply give up after a month or two and be significantly worse off than if they just use Ubuntu's automatic security package updates.","completion":"Perhaps if you can't afford to build a safe system, you should reconsider if you should be in the business of building unsafe ones?"}

{"prompt":"If you take a look at how the GHC Haskell compiler (A \"Sufficiently Smart Compiler(tm)\" in my opinion) works, for example, it is not naively pushing allocating objects, creating thunks and emitting trampoline code.\nInstead, it analyzes the program structures from graphs and emits rather efficient machine code in the end. Not too dissimilar from what your native code emitting C compiler does.\nIf you look at the machine code for something as \"stupid\" as the Haskell example below, the output object code does not resemble the semantics of the source program at all.

I didn't really understand it because I had always trained myself to judge the producer of input by the intent of the producer, rather than by how it affected me (an effect the producer would have had no way of knowing ahead of time).

Companies wanted workers to be interchangeable cogs, and they got what they wished for."}
{"prompt":"A lot of people ask my why I never got a degree. As a .net web developer I don't wan't so spend 4 years part time (no money for fulltime) studying java, because that's what you mostly learn in our country.\nEdit: I maybe should add theres nothing wrong with java. It's just not my choice that's all. And in my country (switzerland) the education system looks little bit different. I started a education at age 16 as software a developer. 2 days school, 3 days work at a software company for four years. Now you add some years of experience and there you are with no degree.. and that's why I wrote my first statement","completion":"Whats wrong with Java? I am focusing most of my time on it. Bad decision?"}
{"prompt":"Very nice, I've often wondered at the lack of embeddable http servers in the c\/c++ world.  Are there any other libraries that do the same thing? What is the status of this project? Is it being used in production anywhere?","completion":"For C, libmicrohttpd\nhttps:\/\/www.gnu.org\/software\/libmicrohttpd\/\nBig list of alternative libraries at the bottom also."}
{"prompt":"We have several similar headlines on HN lately.\nGo\/Rust\/Erlang\/Elixir\/Node\/Nim\/Julia for Python programmers\nIs there a trend away from Python2\/3 or Ruby to language X?","completion":"Yes. I think Ruby is losing popularity or already has long ago, my guess is a lot of those guys moved to Go or JS on Node.\nPython isn't really losing popularity, it's probably gaining as many users as it's losing right now. It's just that a lot of people including myself are completely turned off by Python3, so if we're going to break our old code and take on a ton of testing- may as well do rewrites in a new, potentially better language\/platform.\nFor me, Go has problems (as Python does) but thus far I find it the most appealing of all choices. I tend to be attracted to simpler things (worse is better)."}
{"prompt":"OK, dumb question time. How are front-end and back-end defined?\nTo me the distinction was about the location of execution. \"Front-end\" meant \"in a browser\" and back-end meant \"anywhere else with some surface addressable via HTTP\".\nNow it seems that \"front-end\" means \"View and Controller\" and \"back-end\" means \"Model\", except ... not quite. Sometimes.\nOn the other hand, perhaps I protest too much. It's not as though there's a High Court of Internet Nomenclature for this.","completion":"I'll tell you what - people are starting to get confused because they're talking about back-end client and front-end server. The browser is getting to be a thicker and thicker client, and more and more decoupled from a server (or servers) that expose(s) a completely application-agnostic API to some object store (or stores.) People hit webpages that run applications on the client that allow it to interface with those object stores in some specific manner through APIs.\nWe might need a change in terminology."}
{"prompt":"A question for European readers:\nDo you see the culture of the Welfare State as an obstacle to changing culture to accept that being successful, doing new business ventures is a good thing?","completion":"Support for a social safety net and anti-market ideology don't necessarily have to go together, but in practice they do."}
{"prompt":"Some time ago I noticed that I was using too many parentheses, and adopted a rule that every time I notice myself writing parentheses I stop and consider (1) whether I can just delete them or replace them with commas and (2) whether I can get rid of them in some other way. I find that maybe 90% of the time this leads to an improvement. I wouldn't be at all surprised to find that the same applies to other relatively unusual kinds of punctuation.\nRemark 1: \"sentence\/thought\" contains \"special punctuation\" and is indeed improved by substituting \"sentence or thought\".\nRemark 2: my parenthesis-removal rule turns out not to work very well for programming :-).","completion":"\"Some time ago I noticed that I was using too many parentheses, ... (1) ... (2) ...\"\nWhen I try to eliminate parentheses and similar parentheticals, I write separate sentences if possible."}
{"prompt":"I don't know why but reposting seems to happen a lot on HackerNews. It's not the fact that they get reposted that's bugging me but the fact that the same people upvote them. Why would you still upvote something if you know you've seen it before on HN? It eludes me.","completion":"It proves that re-posting is effective for content owners, although it's really annoying when reposts don't include anything new.  This one seems to sneak through because it's really interesting. I just pre-ordered one."}
{"prompt":"I'm constantly amazed at the entitlement attitude so many have when it comes to APIs and other people's data. Netflix wishes to change the rules on their API so that it fits in with some broader strategy no one knows about, so what? They wish to restrict the flow of data that they collect for their own uses, so what? They no longer wish to allow third-parties to monetize data accessed from a public API, so what? Regardless of what the article states, it is their data and they can do with it as they please. A person's viewing history on Netflix is not that person's data, it is Netflix's data as they are the people who spent the money to collect it. No amount of whining or complaining will change that.\nI can understand people thinking this might be a bad idea for them and I agree that it's possibly a PR mistake. But there is a difference between complaining about access and demanding access to a company's data.","completion":"Worth noting, the API strategy is not exactly secret: http:\/\/gigaom2.files.wordpress.com\/2012\/05\/netflix-api-empha...\n( via http:\/\/gigaom.com\/video\/netflix-42-billion-api-requests\/)"}
{"prompt":"There seems to be a lot of text editors being showcased on HN at the moment. While the engineering involved in each of them is remarkable, and way beyond what I could imagine accomplishing, I've yet to be convinced that any problems are being solved. Nothing I've seen has yet convinced me to move away from my emacs\/git based workflow.\nMaybe they are simply CV showcases, in which case this is an impressive piece of software, and congratulations to the developer, but you've yet to convince me to move away from 1970s technology.","completion":"My similar product (http:\/\/liveditor.com) mainly solves this problem: After tweaking css using Firebug, having to manually copy the changes back to the source code is time-consuming and error-prone.\nAnd LIVEditor's solution is integrating a Firebug-inspired html inspector into a full-featured code editor, of course plus a Chromium-powered real-time preview!"}
{"prompt":"Dave has some reasonable points, and frankly I think MS is going where he'd like them to go.\nBut he does miss the boat on a few things.\nOne thing that I do think he discounts too much is the surprising effectiveness of small focused teams.  In the same way a small startup is more effective than a lumbering machine, a small team of devs is often more effective than 1000 loosely organized volunteers.  The classic example is GCC which has probably 10x more people working on it than any commercial compiler, yet the Intel and MS C\/C++ compilers generally kill it.  Not to mention other less popular compilers like IBM xlc and DEC's Alpha compiler.\nThe contribution list to RoR is impressive, but the quality of the product doesn't scale with the number of contributors.\nI think the question MS has to ask is \"do we forego control to possibly get an incremental increase in product quality?\"  What I've found interesting is the speed at which Silverlight and ASP.NET MVC have improved over the past few years.  With relatively small developer teams, they've increased in quality as fast as any open source projects I know of.\nThe other thing he gets wrong is he conflates framework developers with application developers.  And I think this causes him to see a skewed world-view that developers are \"waiting\" for Microsoft.  In general, app developers, are not waiting for MS to do anything.  You have tight deadlines and are trying to find the best solution today.  You take a snapshot of the world right now and pick the best solution (or starting point).  You don't have the time to ponder what might be available in eight months.\nMost ppl on the MS stack are app developers.  Always has been the case.","completion":"GCC targets way more platforms and compiles way more languages than the Intel and MS compilers do.  That's not an apples and oranges comparison."}
{"prompt":"I have built a chrome app[1] that uses the webkitdirectory feature of chrome. No performance issues whatsoever. Also, we have never received a single complaint from our 500k users about its performance.\nIt would make life easier for developers if Mozilla took an iterative approach.

{"prompt":"> text logs are a universal format\nUh, I don't know what world you live in but I'd like the address because mine sucks in comparison.\nText logs are definitely not a \"universal format\". Easily accessible, sure. Human readable most of the time? Okay. Universal? Ten times nope.\nGive you an example: uwsgi logs don't even have timestamps, and contain whatever crap the program's stdout outputs, so you often end up with three different types of your \"universal format\" in there. I'm not giving this example because it's contrived, but because I was dealing with it the very moment I read your comment.","completion":"\"Text logs\" is not a format at all, so it can't really be a universal format, either. But if there were such a thing as a \"universal\" format, it would probably by definition encompass everything in time and space. You think timestamps are a problem? Just wait until your logs get trapped in a quantum state. Talk about a heisenbug..."}
{"prompt":"Zuckerberg is flat-out wrong in his assertion that Hollywood doesn't understand people building something just because they like building things.  I'm quite sure he's right when it comes to some people in Hollywood, possibly even many of the most powerful people.  But I'll bet that what gets a great writer like Aaron Sorkin up in the morning is the same kind of creative impulse that drives hackers.  Sorkin is a hacker - just in a different medium.\nNone of which is to say that Sorkin's portrayal of Zuckerberg is at all accurate.  In the West Wing, Sorkin once wrote: \"You think I think that an artist's job is to speak the truth [but] an artist's job... is to captivate you for however long we've asked for your attention.\"  I think he's quite right, but it's a heck of a philosophy if you're making a movie about someone still living.","completion":"Further, regardless of the writers' ability to relate to hackers they still need to write stuff that appeals to people. Most people don't enjoy just building things like hackers do."}
{"prompt":"I love Stephenson's novels but this project does not sound appealing. It comes off a bit like a bunch of Internet entrepreneurs got hold of him and said, \"Hey, on the web, we have links and embedded images and stuff. It's called 'Hyper-Text' and is the latest craze. Can we use your name? What's your price?\"","completion":"Stephenson is pretty tech savvy. I can't picture flim-flam merchants dazzling him with the concept of hyper text."}
{"prompt":"I'm a PM, and I consider it my most important responsibility to prevent interruptions from reaching developers. By redirecting inwards-bound interruptions to myself, I've probably reduced developer interruptions by 80% since I started.\nWhat I've found is that the typical developer\/engineer is really bad at saying \"no\" or \"not now\" to others. The solution then is to work the other side (sales, marketing, etc) to interrupt someone else (me) instead. Even if it's a relatively simple technical question from sales, I can convert the in-person active interruption to a passive email notice (at the very least).\nThe typical office environment (and system) is not productive, so at this point it's up to the individuals to reduce the impact of the system on the team's productivity. (which is a sad reality...)","completion":"As a developer, I'd just like to say:  thank you for doing this.  A good PM is literally worth their weight in silver (at today's price, anyway)."}
{"prompt":"How goes giving someone less time to stop before someone else goes not decrease safety?

{"prompt":"I don't get it. Isn't one of the major purposes of using higher level languages to avoid writing in C?","completion":"Sort of. I have no problem with core stuff being \"C\" because I am not using \"C\" to use that library, I am using the HLL to do what I would normally do. Python does this as well (probably Perl and Tcl too)."}
{"prompt":"\"Mathematics is inadequate to describe the universe\"\nThe jury is still out on that one.","completion":"So mathematics is not even adequate to describe the universe? \u201cAdequate\u201d doesn\u2019t imply \u201dperfect\u201c for me."}
{"prompt":"Natural evolution is best? One word: wheel . . .\nLinux as a whole was not designed -- that is easy to accept, and also that it is a strength.\nHowever, design is not so entirely opposed to evolution as might be inferred. Design seems essentially to have some iterative character too. It always entails a some series of ideas, rejections, and then further adjusted ideas. That is deliberately controlled, but it still has variation and selection -- so the possibility of blending between design and evolution is very reasonable.\nAnd given the wheel example, artificial design has something to offer too.\n(I think Torvalds' view is consonant with this. -- I mean, is he not overall offering some combination of evolution and design?)","completion":"Wheels are quite unpractical. Their only advantage is that they require relatively little energy over long distances. However, why not reduce the need for long distances or not create it in the first place?"}
{"prompt":"I love UFO stories, and I love history, and I love pseudo-science. Hell, I even like counter-factuals. What if Lee had won at Gettysburg? What if Patton had actually commanded the Normandy invasion? And so forth.\nBut these things are the province of speculation, not knowledge.\nThink for a minute about what this essay is asking \"What if action X did not end the war in the Pacific?\"\nWell dang, Action X could be just about anything. The fact of the matter is that all of the actions, taken together, were the reason for the war to end. Yes, Stalin played a big role. But it's not an either-or situation; it's an amalgam. The logical structure of trying to support a statement such as \"The Bomb Didn't Beat Japan\" is flawed. It's like saying the landing on Tarawa didn't beat Japan. Well no, and yes. The assertion itself is flawed.\nWhile I love all sorts of semi-non-fictional essays, I have a little warning bell that goes off when I'm mostly through an essay and the essayist starts telling me a story about how I've been misled. Smells of a political agenda and manipulation.\nJapan was threatened on many fronts and made the best choice it could. That much is clear. Atom bombs did not cause as much building and population damage as the fire-bombing did. That's also clear. But atom bombs represented one thing that Stalin and fire-bombing did not: the end of Japanese culture. A few dozen atom bombs would not only have made huge holes in the landscape, it would have erased the culture of Japan.\nNobody is finding comfort in simplistic stories. In fact, the more details people know, the happier I am. But dropping the bombs on Japan saved millions of both Japanese and allied lives. It served as a quick end to a long war, and it saved thousands of allied prisoners whom the Japanese were ready to execute. It also allowed the great Japanese culture to continue.\nMost serious historians don't get into counter-factuals, except maybe as fiction. It just doesn't work.","completion":"When you have the fact that the Japanese had already sent delegations to negotiate a surrender, that everyone who wrote at the time either knew that Japan was trying to surrender or was confident that they would surrender as soon as Russia entered, and that the US Strategic Bombing Survey also concluded that the bombs were unnecessary, we're getting outside the realm of your standard counter-factual here.\nIt's much more like saying 'well, this body was stabbed through the heart and then burned, but they almost certainly would have been dead even without the burning' than 'some complex series of actions occurred and we have no idea which of them was actually relevant in the resulting outcome'."}
{"prompt":"So a few months ago, I posted a submission asking the community whether they'd be interested in an HN-type site for hackers interested in bio\/med, and received a good amount of replies expressing interest and enthusiasm.

It's for anyone interested in the intersection of hacking and life science, from the role of social networks and mobile devices in healthcare to new ways to hack your body.\nMany many thanks to Rust who provided the actual code for the site and used it as an opportunity to develop his own open source project for HN-type sites, which can be found at http:\/\/www.noostr.com.","completion":"Anyone know if there's a rails open source HN-type project?"}

Lots of those out there, and in militaries that easily could become hostile. IFF is not always reliable, (hence the viz ID requirements).\nAnd creating an autonomous UCAS capable of conducting air to air combat isn't going to be cheap at all. The reason we like drones now is because they have the performance characteristics of a Cessna, and they don't put pilots at risk. To compete in A2A combat, they'll need performance (and avionics) that exceed what our best fighters currently have.

Intel, a world leader in processor design, does not need to get into such a sleazy business as antivirus software.\nWhy not spend that $7.7 billion helping the world write better code?","completion":"My guess is that they will be able to use their existing OEM relationships to push for McAfee to be installed by default (and paid for, not just a trial) on more and more computers.\nMcAfee also seems to be moving into different areas of computer security lately (PCI scans, etc), so it's not just anti-virus.

The game starts, and you are given a job on the space station. The mechanics are complex, pretty punishing (permadeath lasts until server reset, or someone clones you etc), and partially irrelevant; incompetence is realistic, and expected. Dysfunction abounds. Some people might be assigned as secret agents and given tasks automatically like theft or murder. Most of the time, however, is spent playing the drunk police officer, crusty cynical mechanic, horribly unhelpful bureaucrat, or janitor who \"forgets\" to put up wet floor signs for amusement. The chemists and farmers trade goods, the scientists perform dangerous experiments for dubious ends, etc.\nThe irony for me is that the only way to restore a true feeling of \"playing a role\" was removing the stats, and many of the normal objectives, and building a theme where the only optimal play is, essentially, to play sub-optimally and just go for whatever is fun (excluding things that get you thrown out an airlock or tossed in jail for a few hours).\nI guess I just got a different idea of what RPG meant from pen-and-paper roleplaying games, and my coding background makes me a bit allergic to games that could be \"solved\"."}

From others I heard \"This property isn't available, but I will offer you this and that\", which were not even comparable.

{"prompt":"> The district court said it felt bound to dismiss her claims because of a 1979 Supreme Court case, Smith v. Maryland. That case involved the collection of the phone numbers dialed by a criminal suspect over the course of three days. It\u2019s one of the cornerstones of the so-called \u201cthird party doctrine,\u201d the idea that people have no expectation of privacy in information they entrust to others\u2014and it\u2019s outdated to say the least.\nPost \"the Fappening\" and the realization that there are essentially no enforceable protections for information you store in the cloud, I'd say Smith v. Maryland makes as much sense as it ever did. After all, back in 1979, call records were stored in a dusty database somewhere, used only for billing purposes. Today, the corresponding data stored by Facebook, Google, etc, are mined, processed, and correlated across time and space for advertising and marketing purposes. If Smith stands for the proposition that the government has at least as much right to access your data for law enforcement purposes as AT&T does for billing purposes, then replacing \"AT&T\" with \"Google\" and \"Facebook\" and \"billing\" with \"advertising\" doesn't undermine the rationale of the case one bit.\nObviously you can argue that it was wrongly decided in the first instance, but that's a different argument.","completion":"Agreed, as usual. ISTM the EFF is begging the question (in the legal sense of assuming one's preferred conclusion as a premise) here by breezily asserting that Smith v. Maryland is outdated, without making any clear showing of why. Yes, you could look at the history of someone's telephone calls and infer that they planned to get an abortion, or had cancer, or had particular preferences in takeout food...but that was equally possible in 1979. Indeed, the EFF mentions government access to 'telephone books' - and while nowadays any telephone books I receive go straight into the recycling bin, back in 1979 they were the normal way of storing information, and my understanding is that telephone companies maintained reverse directories ordered by number.\nThis matters because while the government can obviously process data in a mere millisecond these days (like the private sector does), efficiency of execution has no bearing whatsoever on the question of whether people have an expectation of privacy in their phone records; the holding of Smith v. Maryland is that they do not, because by choosing to place a telephone call they have opted to share that information with the phone company, and the fact of the call becomes a mere business record. The Supreme Court's position was that there's a trade-off between anonymity and convenience, and where one opts for the convenience of a telephone call (facilitated by the telephone company) then one sacrifices any expectation of privacy. This matters since if phone calls are still considered business records 35 years on, then warrants are no more necessary now than they were in 1979.\nThere's a much stronger argument for the privacy of things like email, since one can send encrypted messages on a peer-to-peer basis by the simple expedient of running one's on mail server, even though most people choose to outsource that job to a commercial provider. But phone calls only go through exchanges, and there's no way to bootstrap your way into the phone network that's equivalent to firing up your own SMTP server - if you make a call through Verizon from your cell, how is that fundamentally different from making a call through AT&T from your landline?"}

{"prompt":"I find it sad that people are so obsessed right now with small engines. Small engine does not necessarily mean good efficiency. For instance, I have a C5 Corvette with a 5.7L V8 engine. It gets 29-30MPG on the freeway, and I usually get combined rating for about 27MPG. My friend had an M3 with a much smaller engine but same HP. It was getting maybe 16MPG combined, on a good day. Large engine does not necessarily equal good efficiency.\nThat's why I find all these rules idiotic. I personally would like to see a rule where each car gets X amount of fuel (adjusted in BTUs) per race. So say you can get 100 liters of gas or 85 liters of diesel, because diesel has more BTU\/liter. That's all. Leave the rest up to the teams, let them figure out the most efficient way to spend their fuel. For instance, maybe hydraulic or nematic energy systems are better than electric. Let them try that. Maybe someone want's to do an all electric car with a diesel generator onboard for power, let them try that. Maybe someone want's to try going at it with hydrogen generator \/ electric combo. Let them try that too.\nMillions of dollars are spent on F1, and all that money is being wasted on fiddling with exhaust positioning, rather then trying new and innovative technologies. The \"Prius\" layout is old news, there are better solutions to efficiency.\nYou can reword the most efficient cars by allocating an artificially low amount of fuel per race, and then holding cars in the pits for additional \"penalty\" time for each liter of fuel they take in over the baseline. That way the most competitive car would be the fastest car with the best fuel economy.","completion":"Hard to compare a naturally aspirated motor to a turbo like your friend's M3. When a turbo in a 4 cyl spools up (x rpm) it will drain a lot of fuel.. maybe like a V8. However it still can be driven like a standard naturally aspirated 4 cyl motor consuming far less fuel than a V8. There are just too many variables involved to even compare from ECU to pumps to heavy foot etc."}

That approach works across different languages, sites, and if someone makes new sites.\nTo be clear: the webspam team does reserve the right to take manual action to correct spam problems, and we do. That not only helps Google be responsive, it also improves our algorithms because we get use that data to train better algorithms. With Stack Overflow, I especially wanted to see Google tackle this instance with algorithms first.","completion":"I agree with what you're saying: there needs to be an algorithmic approach.\nBut I'd like to say one other thing.

{"prompt":"The stock market is all about the future, not the past. A lot of people see Microsoft's future as being less profitable than its past. That's why people belittle it.\nMicrosoft makes a ton of money, no one will deny that, but they make less money than they used to. It's funny how the OP shows the financial numbers for one quarter and says the \"the trend here is clear\". You can't determine a trend on one quarter, you have to compare to other quarters.\nHere are some numbers from Google Finance (http:\/\/www.google.com\/finance?q=msft)\nThe first number is Q1 (Mar '12), the second is 2011\nNet profit margin\t\t29.34%\t33.10%\nOperating margin\t\t36.62%\t38.83%\nReturn on average assets\t17.80%\t23.77%\nReturn on average equity\t30.86%\t44.84%\nLooks like the trend is down.\nAlso, their stock price has been basically flat for 10 years.

You send beer to one of them, oh you get the chance to have an interview.\nIf they liked the idea so much to admit Instacart so late with a single founder, it's hard to believe they're doing a great job at screening the applications.\nIMO, every (no-spam) applications should at least have a 2 minutes skype call with one of the YC members. I know it takes time but it's in their interest.","completion":"This is an inaccurate assessment.  Our experience was exactly what YC say it will be for most founders.  We applied and were rejected because we were little more than an idea and two business founders.  We applied again next batch with an alpha site live and several more people on the team, we got an interview.  We didn't know anybody, and never sent any communication to YC beyond our application.\nSince then, I have recommended around 3 applicants to the YC partners.  One did not get an interview despite over $100,000 in sales.  One did and was rejected.  The other was also rejected, and was recently acquired.

{"prompt":"I'm not entirely sure the hula-hooping incident - merely observing girls hula hooping is not a crime, is it? - by itself constitutes a hostile atmosphere for women, unless inappropriate comments were being made.\nWhat we have here is some completely inappropriate, cloak and dagger, soap opera shit being perpetrated by the wife of the cofounder, who has no business meddling in the affairs of his employees. (If true, this is completely bizarre behavior.) But I'm not entirely sure this hostility was directed at her simply because she was a woman.\nShe is absolutely justified in getting the fuck out of dodge, either way.","completion":"I don't think it creates a 'hostile' atmosphere per say. Obviously if both parties are alight with the situation then it's fine for them.\nI think it's an inappropriate one for a workplace though. This comes down to company culture. The problem isn't the women hula hooping, a casual environment means such things will happen. People will exercise together, work on hobbies, etc.\nThe problem is that in a work environment everyone who works there has to be treated with respect, and equally, and that means not cat-calling your co-workers. Even if the women were fine with it (and they probably were since they didn't stop), the large group of men treating them like sexual objects in the workplace is not conducive to an environment where women are respected. If this was a strip club there wouldn't be a problem.\nTo draw a parallel, if 7 out of 10 people at the office were having nerf gun fights, and it was disrupting other peoples work (because they are reflexively duck, etc) to the point where they can't work when there aren\u2019t big nerf gun fights (but still one or two shots every now and then), then it's a problem, and destructive to a good work environment. This is where management needs to step in and say, \"ok guys, I know we are pretty lax around here, but seriously cut this shit out\". Obviously it isn't a perfect parallel.\nIt's also a culture fit thing. This was the thing that broke the camels back. This employee suffered discrimination from executives (and startup founder's significant others are likely going to be part of the executive team one way or another. They certainly have the standing of the executive team in many ways. Legally speaking they are almost the same 'person' in many ways), she suffered discrimination from a single employee, and then she suffered it from a group of employees (a group mentality). And all three of these things feed into each other, and in a work environment (especially a casual one), employees need to be able to move their bodies without worrying about a group of other employees demeaning them."}

It would sell for a higher price than any real artwork ever, and people come from all over the world to see it. The occurrence of this vanishingly unlikely event would be a major event in world history, which many would claim as proof of the existence of God, while others would come up with other even more bizarre hypotheses to explain it. Oh, and it would still be beautiful, although it would not be \"art\". (Though I'm sure many books would be written debating both sides of that very question...)\nAs a more realistic example, many naturally-occurring things (trees, mountains, women) are beautiful but are most certainly not \"art\". So I'm not sure what the real debate here.\nAs for furnace ducts: sure, you can say \"look, a pile of ducts!\" You can say that for anything. You can follow me around all day and point out random objects and say they're neat, and heck, I'll probably agree with you the first couple of times before getting annoyed.

I enjoy language wars as much as anyone else, but languages are only good or bad relative to the type of problem they're being used for.\nFor example, what makes C++ and Java odious is that people try to use them for inappropriate purposes. They aren't platonically \"evil\" languages, and they weren't designed by stupid people; they're just inappropriate for over 90 percent of what modern programmers have to do in their professional lives. When people need high-level features and don't have them, they tend to roll their own-- badly. This is Greenspun's Tenth Rule and the heart of those god-awful \"design patterns\".\nC++ and Java, for all that, also have domains in which they're the appropriate languages to use. They're just very small.","completion":"C needn't be the only credible option in its domain forever.\nThere is another axis of 'badness', other than suitability for the problem domain. C's main problem is features that look fine but might subtly invoke wrong behaviour - the infamous traps and pitfalls.\nIf you can accept this view, then there \/can\/ be such a thing as a bad language, and it can be possible for two languages to suit the same domain and one to be better than the other. The domain that C serves well is not going away (though it might shrink, as more suitable tools are used for things like compiler-writing), but a better langauge for the domain could come along in the end."}

One point I would have liked to have seen: the number of homeschool parents who are former teachers. More than half of our homeschool friends are former teachers. This means these parents worked in the public school system, and when it came time to send there kids decided \"nope, I'm not sending my kids through that system\".\nAs for startup ideas: I want MOOC aimed at younger kids.

{"prompt":"I think this is another good example of how we as an industry are still unable to adequately assess risk properly.\nI'm fairly certain that the higher-ups in Twitter weren't told \"We have pretty good failover protection, but there is a small risk of catastrophic failure where everything will go completely down.\"  Whoever was in charge of disaster recovery obviously didn't really understand the risk.\nJust like the recent outages of Heroku and EC2, and just like the financial crisis of 2008 which was laughably called a \"16-sigma event\", it seems pretty clear that the actual assessment of risk is pretty poor.  The way that Heroku failed, where invalid data in a stream caused failure, and the way that EC2 failed, where a single misconfigured device caused widespread failure, just shows that the entire area of risk management is still in its infancy.  My employer went down globally for an entire day because of an electrical grid problem, and the diesel generators didn't failover properly, because of a misconfiguration.\nYou would think after decades that there would be a better analysis and higher-quality \"best practices\", but it still appears to be rather immature at this stage.  Is this because the assessment of risk at a company is left to people that don't understand risk, and that there is an opportunity for \"consultants\" who understand this, kind of like security consultants?","completion":"Your examples describe two entirely different systems. The failover of a software product is drastically different from the failover of a power system.

{"prompt":"To counter your anecdote with my anecdote, I've observed the complete opposite.\nAn American professional will easily afford a car (and two cars for a 2-adult household), will be able to go out to lunch regularly and go out to dinner when they please.  If they want to see a specialist for a medical issue they'll have an appointment in a day.\nA Danish professional may not have a car at all for a few years out of college and will likely struggle to have a second car for their partner even as a senior-level employee.  They will bring their lunch every day and rarely if ever go out for dinner.  Their medical issues will take weeks or months to be seen if deemed non-emergency and they'll have less choice in which doctor they see.\nIt's probably easier to be at the bottom of society in western Europe than in the US, but for anyone in the American middle class their quality of life would go down substantially if the moved to Scandinavia.","completion":"What medical specialists are you seeing? From my experience a few weeks to a few months is the norm here in the US too."}
{"prompt":"> Objective-C doesn't use methods like Java\/C++\/C#, it uses messages like Smalltalk. This effectively means it always performs late binding and invoking a message is REALLY slow in Objective-C.\nWell, \"always\" is a little wrong. The first time a message is passed and the bound method is called by the runtime is significantly slower (~4x slower than a virtual method call in C++). But then this message\/method pair gets cached and for every subsequent call the cache is used.\nThen there's some real neat trickery that is performed in objc_msgSend() ... after the method to \"call\" has been found the code directly jumps into that method without creating a new stack frame. (All needed arguments have been passed to objc_msgSend() and are already on the stack.) objc_msgSend() in essence is a trampoline.\nSo when sending a message to an object multiple times you only pay for the cache lookup - which is pretty fast by itself and a cached call is faster than a C++ virtual method call.\nPerformance Numbers: http:\/\/www.mikeash.com\/pyblog\/performance-comparisons-of-com...\nMore about objc_msgSend(): http:\/\/www.mikeash.com\/pyblog\/friday-qa-2012-11-16-lets-buil...\nNow I don't know enough about Java but I guess it isn't much more faster than that.

{"prompt":"Has anyone really not seen this in the last two years?\nAnyway, Linus may be a very experienced C programmer, but that doesn't mean his opinion on C++ carries much weight...

{"prompt":"I challenge you all to make two changes today with regard to this. First, switch your phone to give you the weather in Celsius. It gets super simple fast:\n0 and below - Freezing.

Long sleeves are probably in order, maybe even a sweater.\n15-20 - Late spring. Wear short sleeves.\n20+ - Warm to hot. Wear short sleeves. If it gets to be 24+ shorts are appropriate.\nI am deliberately not giving conversions to Fahrenheit here because I think that's how you just go back to using it. Try to internalize the metric system here.\nThe second challenge is to switch your clocks\/watches to the 24 hour mode. Not strictly metric system related, but you will not have to worry about AM vs PM again.\nFor the advanced users: switch your car to show your speed in km\/h instead of m\/h.\nFor the super-advanced users: try to figure out how many liters per 100 km does your car consume :).\nEdit: if you cook (and you really should), use a scale set to grams instead of measuring cups for any recipes you are making. Almost all foods list both oz's and grams on them. You will get much more accurate measurements this way and will learn to gauge what 150 grams of cheese looks like, etc.","completion":"It reminds me when we moved from national money (Franc) to Euro in Europe. The conversion rate was something like 1 Euro was 1.67 Francs (IIRC).

{"prompt":"> Myth lets you write pure CSS while still giving you the benefits of tools like LESS and Sass.\nHaving a \"polyfill\" is certainly a valid justification. But this doesn't come close to LESS\/Sass -- I'd argue that the main feature of those is nested rules, and then mixins.\nVariables and calculations are great, but most LESS code I've encountered uses nesting and mixins to a far greater extent. Advertising the project as \"the benefits of tools like LESS and Sass\" seems misleading, and seems to set up expectations that Myth doesn't fulfill.","completion":"It's not supposed to replace LESS\/SASS, it's a supplement.

Are people (Harvard professors!) not reading as much as they used to? Are they less concerned about editing?

They are sealed, non upgradable, relatively disposable devices that are intentionally obsoleted by their manufacturers every 12-18 months. It makes for a nice marketing bullet point, but are we actually getting anything besides a bigger number to impress the impressionable customer with?","completion":"You can't just release a 64 bit chip and expect a full stack of 64-bit clean software to be available on day 1. Indeed, last time I checked Dalvik wasn't fully 64-bit clean. Releasing earlier than you need it ensures that by the time you do need it, the software is ready to go.\nAlso, besides the correct points made in sister comments, there is the issue that virtual address space is used for things other than simply mapping physical memory. There was a time, for example, when Linux mapped all of physical memory into the kernel's virtual address space. This was simple. These days, on 32-bit systems, it splits the 4GB address space into 3GB for the user and 1GB for the kernel, and maps physical memory in and out of a 128MB window in kernel space, as needed. This is obviously more complicated."}

{"prompt":"Prediction:  The sexism in IT problem will never end.\nHere's my hypothesis:\n1.  Women and men are different.  We see this played out all around us, all the time, both sides happily make and laugh at jokes about it, and no one has a problem acknowledging this fact during discussion of other topics, but when certain subjects are being discussed, these very same people will assure you, with total sincerity, that there is no difference between men and women.\n2. IT is a male dominated field, and it is distinctly different from other \"professional\" fields.  There is something about IT that either appeals especially to males, or males are particularly skilled at.  I have no idea why.  And, a significant portion of these men have very high technical skills, but relatively undeveloped social skills, which shouldn't be surprising.  Other professions require social skills in addition to the skills dedicated to the profession.

If you are very paranoid or traveling a lot, you can add:\n4. Don't log in from insecure devices.\n5.

Imagine how excited, how delighted, these kids would be with all of the possibilities afforded by an iPad. The diverse critical development opportunities and perceptual stimuli would seem to far outweigh the advantages of being able to think like a programmer or whatever. And, it would just be so much more fun for them, in my opinion.","completion":"There is a maximum amount of delight children are capable of achieving, and it really doesn't take a great deal to get them there.

Customers who bite the bullet and buy a vehicle nearly always come away feeling like the dealer took advantage of them.\nKudos to Tesla for taking on this cartel.\n--\n[1] Edmunds lists the following types of fees charged by traditional car dealers at the time of sale: \"registration fees,\" \"doc fees,\" \"trade-in fees,\" \"dealer fees,\" \"holdback,\" \"financial reserve,\" and \"advertising fees.\"  Good luck trying to figure out what these fees ought to be for the vehicle you want to buy.

Key car features and options are bundled in arbitrary packages and priced in ways that make pricing even more opaque.\nThis is my ongoing remark on this topic: walking into a particular dealership is a mistake. You're making it hard for yourself to use your only negotiation asset - the option to go elsewhere. Figure out the features you need and contact multiple dealerships for a quote. This sets up a much more better game for you. But yeah, dealerships still suck."}

{"prompt":"As others have been pointing out feverishly on Twitter: the problem wasn't them betting too much on HTML5. Their problem was developing piece of shit apps that happened to use HTML5. They tasked amateurs who didn't know what they were doing into building a hybrid native app container which in turn embedded HTML5 content. Plenty of other developers (Instagram and LinkedIn come to mind) have figured out how to do that right, and in a way where it is seamless to the end user and for all intents and purposes feels exactly the same as a native app.\nI'm not saying that it's an easy problem. You have to find the right balance between which components should be native or not. It's clear from the other problems that Facebook's been able to solve that they know how to hire top-notch developers. They just failed to do so for their mobile efforts, which just reinforces the stereotype that they don't \"get\" mobile.","completion":"How can you make your HTML5 code as fast as native?

They hurl insults like \"weak\" and \"fragile\" as though someone isn't allowed to be shy ever since the internet happened. The sheer amount of greed on display in debates about this game is deeply unnerving, and it seems as though modern culture has forgotten that there are many things that are more important than money.

{"prompt":"One thing we can all do:\nStart asking before you touch in situations where you know you don't have to.\nI know it's awkward. But the reason people like Joe think they can put their hands down someone's pants is because we don't have a cultural practice of \"ask first\". They see you put your arms around that friend of yours who doesn't mind at all, and they think \"Ah, cool... so you can just sense if she's cool with it and then go for it\".\nOf course you're not a scumbag, so you'd never put your hands down someone's pants without asking, but that's the thing... scumbags can't tell the difference. They don't see the difference between you rubbing your friend's back because she's having a bad day--your friend who is happy to have a little contact from you--they don't see the difference between that and them taking a body shot off of their employee without asking. In both cases they just see someone making their best guess at what someone else wants, without asking, and going for it. That's the cultural standard, that's your standard, so that's what they hold themselves to.\nBasically, right now we try to draw the line between ask\/don't ask as close to the ok\/not ok line as we possibly can. But in a world where people make mistakes that means there are lots of \"accidents\".  The only way to prevent those accidents is to move the ask\/don't ask line further into \"ok\" territory.\nSexual assault might seem like an issue between individuals, but as long as we see it that way it will continue happening.

One thin, tiny fiber can carry an INSANE amount of information. The problem is the processing circuitry that converts these light signals into digital signals.

It is not to be disputed, that the publisher of a newspaper in this country, without a very exhaustive advertising support, would receive less reward for his labor than the humblest mechanic.\"\nThe fact is people dramatically underestimate what it costs to produce high quality content and that as a rule you'd need to spend much more than you'd expect to have access to it.\nAdvertising has essentially made information free or cheap for the user for a long time.

Every time.\nIf employees were assumed to be exploring many things simultaneously, both sides would have plenty of chances to gather meaningful data about the employer\/employee relationship, and if it is really a great fit, a long term employment arrangement could be worked out, with a contract that reflects mutual responsibilities revolving around this shift to an all-eggs-in-one-basket situation for the employee - and likely a corresponding move to much more critical functions being performed for the company.\nI cynically suspect the current concept of full-time work evolved to suit employers, it allows them to manipulate and scare employees, especially when (for example) health insurance is at stake. Employers naturally have more data about salaries and so forth, in general most employers have many employees, while most employees only have one employer. That is inherently asymmetrical. Now that certain skill sets are harder to hire for, it is hurting everyone.\nBut the situation was never that great from the beginning, let's figure out a way to make it better for everyone.","completion":"I don't particularly enjoy the hiring process.

It means my team members have less security that the coworker of theirs who is specializing in ____ will be here in 6 months.\nProbationary periods in new hire contracts exist for that \"this isn't a mutually good fit\" issue.\nUltimately it feels like an \"everyone is a contractor\" default will end up increasing overhead for the company, reducing productive time available for people involved in hiring (my developers have to interview a new hire, as well), and less security for both the contractor and the employer."}

And the user only really cares whether the particular movie that they use the algorithm to select is good or disappointing.\nSimilarly, users come here to read the exceptional comments, and a community in which every comment deserved to get 3 karma points would soon find itself without users.\nIn this way, removing comment scores may be part of an effective solution, but it may not be the crucial component because it only indirectly changes the accessibility of excellent comments.\nInstead, actively trying to make it easier for people to read what they consider exceptional is a goal worth pursuing."}

That's particularly true here in Australia at the moment (amidst a minority government with a lot of political sniping on both sides and seemingly very little real progress) despite the fact that we have a comparatively strong economy, low inflation, low unemployment and generally nothing really significant (again, comparatively) to complain about.","completion":"> Although I don't necessarily think it will be because of war, I can see a potential future where people\/persons decide democracy is a less effective system because it's holding back the decision making process\nThat's something Darth Vader could have said.\nOh, wait, he did :-)"}

Nobody is willing to accept responsibility for the problems and everybody believes they will somehow be resolved without their personal intervention. Even as somebody who is genuinely concerned and willing to accept responsibility, there seems to be nothing of worth that I can actually do to help.\nThe scariest part is that we can well and truly pass the point of no return before we even realise there's a problem to be addressed.

By the time we realise how much we've upset a system and that awareness propagates down to a significant proportion of the world's population, the damage is done and we can't do anything to fix it.

Frankly, I would tune out. In a libertarian society, every person would need to be educated on food systems, why some are ethical and why some aren't, etc. And only then could we have an equitable system that is supported by choice. But people don't want to invest that much into understanding the thing that keeps them nourished.\nThis is the problem I see with libertarianism. Without some form of, hopefully mild coercion, people just tune out based on gut feeling. If they don't want to participate and contribute to something after the quick-and-dirty explanation, then they're out -- nevermind the 3 year study and expert panel that analyzed the issue and recommended process\/measure\/regulation X.\nI agree that our legislation and regulations need to be more responsive and aligned with reality, but gunning for everything to be \"opt-out\" does not seem sustainable.\nSorry, I go back and forth.

This can be paid for in large part by the abolition of welfare systems, unemployment, Social Security, etc.\nThe stock criticism is that people wouldn't work, because they wouldn't have to. Frankly, I don't want such poorly motivated people working anyway, because they're not productive.

Just like the others Vine will try to convince you that through focus groups they have found \"3 second\" videos will revolutionize video sharing and discovery, but this is nothing new.\nExamples:\nThreadlife: Supports 3 second videos\nViddy:  Supports 15 second videos  \nAnimoto:  Supports 30 second videos\nKlip:  Supports 60 second videos\nnow Vine and its 6 second videos.\nI am left wondering, what problem do all these video sharing apps think they are solving by setting arbitrary video time limits?  Short videos might increase likelihood a user will sit through a whole video, but contrary to what these apps want you to believe they are not improving content quality through these arbitrary time limits.  Further, time limits do not help users discovery quality content, so what problem have any of these apps solved?\nThe company that is dubbed the \"Instagram of video\" in the media is going to do the same thing Instagram did, improve content sharing and discovery.  Of course, I hope my start up is that company, but even if not I think it is safe to say the company who deserves this title will not get it for setting video time limits as a result of focus groups.\nDisclosure:  I founded my own video sharing website with the goal to address the current problems with video sharing and discovery.

{"prompt":"People are complaining about the length of time it takes to get treatment, and the cost of treatment, and that treatment is a racket.\nAll that stuff is true.  All that stuff is avoided by losing weight.\nYour comment appears to be overly sensitive to a calm, non-judgemental bit of information.\nEDIT: Here's the link to the CDC page which lists overweight as a cause of sleep apnea: http:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/healthyweight\/effects\/index.html\nIt's really easy for people, especially men, to hit a BMI of 30 and not realise that they are obese.  Especially in obesogenic societies where very many people are obese, morbidly obese or even super obese.  This carries a range of health risks, most of which are helped by losing weight.\nIt's weird the source article doesn't mention weight, since it is caused by lack of sleep (especially in children and young people) and causes lack of sleep (in adults).\nhttp:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/sleep\/about_sleep\/chronic_disease.htm\n> Laboratory research has found that short sleep duration results in metabolic changes that may be linked to obesity. Epidemiologic studies conducted in the community have also revealed an association between short sleep duration and excess body weight. This association has been reported in all age groups\u2014but has been particularly pronounced in children. It is believed that sleep in childhood and adolescence is particularly important for brain development and that insufficient sleep in youngsters may adversely affect the function of a region of the brain known as the hypothalamus, which regulates appetite and the expenditure of energy","completion":"Firstly, if you are obese, losing weight will indeed ameliorate or eliminate a very wide range of common health problems.  High blood pressure and metabolic precursors to type 2 diabetes are, in particular, very responsive to weight loss.\nBut even if no-one were obese, obstructive sleep apnea would still exist.  Anyone who snores could have it.  The person may have a deviate septum.  They might have swollen tonsils or adenoids.  They might have a congenitally narrow airway.  Maybe even a particularly long uvula.\nAnd then there are the non-obstructive (worse) sleep apneas, such as those caused by defects in the nervous system, where the brain is unable to tell the diaphragm to move.\nBeing thin is not a perfect defense against sleep apnea.  Nevertheless, it appears that the vast majority of apneas are worsened by obesity, and obesity is worsened by sleep deprivation.  That is a vicious cycle.\nWith my foil hat on, I suspect that safe and effective treatments for reducing body fat in obese individuals are not being researched for public health reasons (esp. as preventative measures against heart disease and diabetes), because an non-curing treatment for fatness would make ten times more money than boner pills, especially in the US.  And this is why you get people doing DIY fecal transplants from thin friends in their own kitchens, or buying and injecting barely-tested research peptides (like cyclized CKGGRAKDC-GG-D(KLAKLAK)2 HCl salt) from Chinese synthesis labs.  The health care system wants all the money, and the people who need the treatments most just don't have enough of it.  When the flow of cash takes priority over patient well-being, people start to do crazy things out of desperation, and a sense that the doctors are acting as drug pushers instead of trying to help them get well."}

And for that reason, it seems to me that a lot of Zynga shareholders were holding Zynga shares not because they want to own Zynga, but because they want to own Facebook and there was no way to buy Facebook on the public markets until today.\nSo a lot of Zynga shareholders were merely holding Zynga as a proxy for Facebook. Once Facebook was offered all those people decided to sell Zynga to buy Facebook. And Zynga tanked accordingly.\nNow of course you will ask, why did Facebook seem to tank at the same time. If my theory about Zynga was true would that not mean that Facebook should go up as Zynga tanks. Yes, if all other things are equal. But in this case they were not. Facebook went down for a different reason. The reason Facebook went down is the usual immediate post IPO sell-off when a bunch of people that got into the IPO sell their shares immediately to make some quick profit.\nSo yeah, I wish I had thought about that yesterday.","completion":"I subscribe to your hypothesis that people were trading Zynga as a proxy for Facebook.

The broad social contract is that we won't trample all over each other, physically or emotionally, so we establish laws at the boundaries. Cross the boundary and you face punishment.\nFor example, it's not illegal to take photos of people on the street, yet US society has a love-hate relationship with the paparazzi.

There are 49 four & five-star reviews. That's not good. Anyone claiming this is the next Google is either straight up lying to generate interest (It's the Next Google!\u2122) or has no idea what they're talking about.","completion":"It's reasonably likely that a good portion of the 1 star reviews aren't opinions of the app, but are rather expressions of disapproval of the funding\/ecosystem\/bubble situation."}
{"prompt":"I'm not someone who would take advantage of the legalization of marijuana, but I am in favor of legalization because I don't think it's the government's job to tell you what you can or can't do. If drinking is legal, smoking weed should be too.\nI understand the concept behind a tax on marijuana, but I don't understand a 25% tax on every stage of the process... If you're saying that it's legal to use marijuana responsibly and you're limiting how much you can buy, I don't see the point of a whole 25% tax on top of that.\nIs marijuana bad and the government needs to bribed to let it?

{"prompt":"I think like a lot of myths, there is a kernel of truth in the 10x programmer myth.\nThe fact is, some problems are hard. Some problems are beyond the grasp of some developers. Even given unlimited time an individual may not ever accomplish the goal. I can certainly think of problem sets where that is true of myself.\nIn those specific circumstances, that person can be considered a \"10x programmer\" when compared with another.","completion":"That might be true, but those problems are rare. The majority of developers will never encounter one, and if they do they'll use a library or middleware to solve the problem and they'll just move on, maybe without even realising they've faced a problem they could never have solved themselves."}
{"prompt":"The bad thing about satellite that makes it unsuitable for many use cases will always remain to be latency, not speed or availability. 1.5 second ping is perfectly usable for web browsing, but it is painful for many other workflows..

I can't express the stress and despair this poor guy had in voice while talking to him, explaining there was nothing that I could do on my end and that he would have to contact PayPal and try to explain the situation and get the funds released. Ultimately the conference went on, but I never followed up to find out how, if he got the funds released, worked something out with the convention center or something.","completion":"I am beginning to think that probably a good comparison of PayPal would be a firewall where people report packets to be looked at manually. Braintree works differently and should not have the same problems."}

We have concrete evidence  they nailed peoples personal email accounts and social networks merely as a means to an get crypto keys in mass. Sure, the potential mass surveillance is exceedingly problematic, but thats mainly problematic because of the potential for abuse. Abuse that we either assumed would happen or already had, but as far as I know there was little direct evidence of.\nThe absolute lowest bar for surveillance seems to be that a government doesn't use it to intentionally target innocent people\/ those not in the game (hell, lets lower it even further to be only people the government themselves believe are innocent).[0]\nThat potentially allows dragnet collection of data if no one looks at it. It might allow hacking just a company's servers  to get access to third party data. It probably allows you to spy on foreign heads of state (even if it's a boneheaded move).

{"prompt":"A serious question: while I have nothing against Silk Road (the drug war is a waste of money anyways), aren't people afraid of putting stuff in their body that they had an anonymous person send to them? I mean, unless the seller has a reputation, isn't there is a substantial risk of using that drug?\nAre my fears unfound? On one hand, the idea of buying drugs online is probably more safe than doing it on the streets, but the anonymity this offers has a potential downside like the one I mentioned above.","completion":"This applies to most recreational drug taking.

Writing an interpreter gives a huge kick and reading other peoples code is always nice.\nFor real world projects, it's not a bad idea to implement your own memory manager (even if it's only a wrapper for malloc and free).

{"prompt":"I think as has always been the case, money talks more then words ever could in a political system. If these 100+ tech companies each put in a few dollars, they would have enough lobbying money to swing the argument in the right direction. We are only at the current point in the anti-net neutrality argument because ISP's and telecommunication providers have been lobbying Washington rather successfully.\nIt's a sad fact he with the biggest cheque book wins, especially when it comes to reform. Look at the whole music\/movies piracy argument, it extends as far back as the late nineties; publisher groups, the likes of the RIAA suing people and skewing the legal system by throwing money at the right people who have the power to vote and act upon such decisions. It's happening all over again, except this time the repercussions will be far worse then any anti-piracy bill.\nI'm not saying lobbying is the only solution, but if the entities on the wrong side of the argument are doing it, does it matter if Google, Amazon, Facebook and other companies issue statements and express concerns to congress if it will only fall on deaf ears or be brushed off as a selfish act?\nIt kind of reminds me of when Labor were in power in Australia before the recent election and were in the process of rolling out the National Broadband Network (NBN) which was a fibre to the premises plan the current party has basically scrapped. Google Australia issued a statement saying the current Government needs to understand the value of such a network, but they were shrugged off.

The fundamental issue is that notable people in technology are almost entirely male. We need to encourage girls to come into technology fields at the bottom. Perhaps ensuring public panels contain notable female role models would be a way of doing that, but if the panels purpose is for very specific technical discussion arbitrarily increasing female participation to levels significantly above what is representative of the field being discussed isn't really going to help anything."}
{"prompt":"If you optimize a framework for beginners, you're optimizing for learnability. That's great for the first few days or even weeks of learning. But once you're past that, it's not so great. What you care more about is the usability of the thing once you know it. There are plenty of cases where learnability and usability are in conflict. Letting learnability win is a short-term relief.\nIf you on the other hand optimize for usability, for making things simple and easy to use for someone who understands the basics, you'll often end up with something that has great learnability as well. Maybe not as much as could be achieved as if that was your only goal, but plenty still.\nThe other aspect is whether you as a framework designer are designing something for yourself and your peers or if you're trying to dumb things down on behalf of beginners. In other words, designing for what you think beginners might find easy in their learning phase. That's really hard to do. Most technology I've seen designed in such a master\/apprentice fashion sucks.\nFinally, when you're comparing complexity, it's generally more helpful to look at the complexity involved with completing an entire task. Comparing complexity of \"hello world\" tells you little about what the complexity is going to be like developing a complete, modern web application from database migrations to XSS\/CRSF protection.\nThat's where learnability and usability are again in conflict. Yes, it's harder to learn a framework that has answers for things like \"how do I migrate a database once I have data I care about\", or whatever feature you want to focus on, but once you hit that problem, you'll be glad that it's there and find the solution less complex than stringing something together from tons of separate parts yourself.\nAll that being said, I think Sinatra is wonderful.

{"prompt":"It's my impression that the discussion about ports, \"full range of bits\", \"assurance that it works\" vs. \"decentralized\" misrepresents Linux distros, or at least Debian - apt provides the full range of dependency tracking, package configuration, etc., and Debian maintains a centralized repository, often with local patches (just like ports), where things are guaranteed to work.  The only real difference is the emphasis on source vs binary, which is important but not as fundamental as the article suggests.\nEdit: And later on...\nThe individual releases of a given distribution are much more independent of each other, so it's harder to turn your RedHat 7.3 system into a RedHat 8 system.

If we are going to talk about this, we need to all fall under the assumption that we agree that this is both a very tragic act perpetrated by someone who is obviously disturbed\/mentally ill, and that it is all of our desires to do what we can to make sure senseless acts of violence like this never happen again.\nSo where do we go from here? How do we prevent this from happening again? It seems that there are two schools of thought (generalizing obviously): 1. Disarm everyone, and 2. Allow everyone to carry weapons. Regardless of which side you fall in, neither work perfectly unless they are complete (i.e. all weapons are gone thus criminals don't even have access, or everyone is armed and no one has the upper hand).

It has layering violations, inconsistencies, needless complexity, bad compromises, misses a lot of ripe opportunities, etc. I would flunk students in my (hypothetical) protocol design class if they submitted it. HTTP\/2.0 also does not improve your privacy. Wrapping HTTP\/2.0 in SSL\/TLS may or may not improve your privacy, as would wrapping HTTP\/1.1 or any other protocol in SSL\/TLS. But HTTP\/2.0 itself does nothing to improve your privacy. This is almost triply ironic, because the major drags on HTTP are the cookies, which are such a major privacy problem, that the EU has legislated a notice requirement for them. HTTP\/2.0 could have done away with cookies, replacing them instead with a client controlled session identifier. That would put users squarely in charge of when they want to be tracked and when they don't want to\u2014a major improvement in privacy. It would also save bandwidth and packets.

(The easiest way to set up a US bank account if you don't physically reside in the US is to do it through a local branch of a US-homed megabank.  Despite the general impression of a lot of freelancers on this matter, international commerce is in fact fairly routine and \"the Patriot Act\" -- Know Your Customer and anti-moneylaundering regulations -- are not an absolute barrier to this.)\nYou should probably avoid using Paypal for transfers of more than a few hundred dollars.

They obviously limit opportunities for social mobility towards people that can be subsidized, or otherwise have access to liquidity. There's something really insidious about pushing people away from increasingly wide classes of cushy jobs they're otherwise perfectly capable of performing.\nStartups: pay your (non technical) interns minimum wage, at least.

Like all PR statements, they try to say the minimum amount possible to calm people down, since everything they do say will get picked apart by the press.

{"prompt":"Well, it was \"better\" on every axis except one -- it was centralized.  But anyone could be an issuer of a currency, on his own infrastructure (potentially run by third parties), so while each currency was centralized, you could have an arbitrary number of currencies, and meta-currencies (e.g. a \"this is a basket of all USD IOUs from US Fortune 500 companies\").  There was no inherently centralized point; open source software, a bunch of loosely connected servers, and using realtime markets for the decentralization.\nBeing decentralized is a huge advantage for Bitcoin in a lot of scenarios, but where being decentralized doesn't help, Bitcoin has a lot of baggage, is slow, inefficient, not inherently cryptographically secure (i.e. the safety comes from size of network, not for the first participant based on the strength of a public key algorithm).  So, IMO, in the ideal world we'll have both something like Bitcoin for when decentralized single currencies are needed, and a bunch of centralized currencies for other purposes.\nThe closest thing active right now is Chris Odom (\"Fellow Traveller\")'s Open Transactions (http:\/\/opentransactions.org\/wiki\/index.php?title=Main_Page)\nI think they have a commercial company in this area: http:\/\/monetas.net\/ but I know basically nothing about it.","completion":"FTP is every bit better than BitTorrent, except for that whole centralization thing."}
{"prompt":"I think the thing that frustrates me the most about all of this is not the privacy, but the fact that Facebook gets exclusive access to data that I think is rightfully public knowledge. I'm fine with advertisers knowing that I really enjoy hiking, what my salary is, etc., but I don't like that they have to go through Facebook to get that knowledge. Ideally, they would go through me, or even better some publicly available repository of data that I've allowed to be assembled.\nBut there is also data that I may not want to be public knowledge. If Facebook scans my chat logs, then Facebook knows a lot about me that I would not want some of my friends and family knowing. And I wouldn't be surprised if their TOS permits them to scan my chat logs.\nAnd you can also do interesting oracle attacks with this. Let's say I'm trying to figure out if my son is homosexual. (Substitute for any fact Facebook may know, and for any person you want to investigate). I already know a ton of things about my son. Age, where he lives, what sports he plays, his favorite foods, etc. So I create one really specific ad that's guaranteed to include only my son and maybe a few other people. This one is only shown to homosexuals. Then I create an alternate ad that targets the same group, but only heterosexuals.

{"prompt":"As a student of classical I'd like to point out what I believe to be the main in-humanness in the generated music that makes it stray from \"real\" classical.\nSome have cried violation of counterpoint, but I don't think that is such an issue here. CP is mostly about how notes are linked together on a small scale, and this is rather the network's strong point: it seems to concentrate on the associativity between notes and between chords, and any given moment seems to be composed with a vision that only extends to a few bars (or even just a few beats) around that moment.\nThe main problem is therefore large-scale structure. For one, recurrence of melodies (at key moments and transpositions) is crucial to creating the emotional value of classical music. None of this appears here.\nAnd secondly, possibly the greatest shortfall of the present neural network (I'm ignoring performance, of course) is the harmonic structure. Classical music, let's say later than medieval and earlier than late-romantic in style, generally has the harmonic structure of a recursive cadence. Harmonic cadences are what give emotional power to harmony, but this NN is painfully incapable of creating any.\nThat being said, I don't think this problem is inherent to the approach of creating music with NNs. Right now it sounds like what you'd get with a well-crafted Markov chain, but NNs can go beyond this, and this article is exactly the kind of thing that will instigate this evolution.","completion":"The author could change the generation of piece by generating a short theme, then fixing that theme at particular points in the note sequence and then generate the gaps, and then repeat the thing as recursively as he wants.\nThis would provide some recurrence of melodies and would sound infinitely better. Problem with these kinds of models is the window based structure without the notion of the general theme. Theme should then be added by the human, and everything else can be filled using the model."}

{"prompt":"This post is amusing because it writes off Windows, but then claims that the UX and the developer tools are the two areas where there's a lot of work to be done on modern UNIX systems.\nFor those who haven't used them professionally, Microsoft's developer tools are absolutely fantastic. And not just the editors, debuggers, and code assistance -- the profiling, system monitoring, and large project workflow tools are years ahead of anything that you can get off-Windows. Even if you're willing to pay Real Money to IBM, the only other serious tools vendor left, or pre-merger Sun, which had the best non-Windows profiling support in-system. Coming back to XCode, the GNU stack, and Eclipse after years on the MSFT platform was like taking a flying leap back into 1998.\nUX is pretty consistent on both the Apple and Windows platforms. Once you learn a couple of apps, you've basically learned them all.

Unfortunately, even the best intentions can't shield you from having to comply with business, taxation, and financial regulations. Make no mistake, regretsy was in the wrong here. Paypal was in the wrong here too, but mostly because they were rude and unhelpful in enforcing a legitimate policy enacting legal and regulatory requirements.","completion":"\"Once is an accident. Twice is coincidence. Three times is an enemy action.\"\nPaypal has had a number of these gaffes reach a high level of public interest in the last year.  Whether the customer was \"in the wrong\"  is not a material issue -- the consumer perception is more significant.  If the customers feel cheated, they are going to draw attention to the issue.\nCompanies make a deliberate choice about how much they want to invest in customer relationships.  Paypal has assigned a very low value, here, in the name of keeping customer service costs low.   The results are specific instances of customer outrage which have an interesting network effect -- the irritation propagates quicker, and further, because of the increasing connectivity of the social graph.\nThe end-result is either Paypal reconsidering their customer investment, or a widening opportunity for another service capturing market share."}

We spend roughly 2x as much as anyone else in the developed world, for mostly worse outcomes.  With way more friction.\nThe debacle of US infrastructure, particularly in a place like the valley.  Poor and overpriced telecommunications.  Incredibly high housing costs.  Terrible transportation.  No real attempt to address any of the above.

That's fantastic news, that means that money is no longer as important as it used to be for simple stuff like that.

That doesn't mean they should stop doing it, what point is there in having money if you can't enjoy it, whatever floats your boat I'm fine with you having it, but there is a catch.\nHere in the EU there used to be a save first, spend later mentality.

Cars, boats, furniture, package holidays and so on.

That's where the real problem lies, given the opportunity to borrow money at initial rates that are designed to lure people in with the nasty consequences written in very small print in gray on slightly-less-gray backgrounds people will fall for it every time.\nBanks are the problem, not the people that think they in fact can afford this stuff.","completion":"This is such a strange and pernicious thing to say.

You don't want to always clear that bit, or else you'd get weirdness like \"`\" being the lowercase form of \"@\", so there's a couple of corner-cases to check.\nCase-sensitivity for Unicode is a giant mud-ball by comparison. There's no simple bit flip to apply, just a 66KB table of mappings[1] you have to hard-code. And that's not all! Changing the case of a Unicode string can change its length (\u00df -> SS), sometimes lower -> upper -> lower is not a round-trip conversion (\u00df -> SS -> ss), and some case-folding rules depend on locale (In Turkish, uppercase LATIN SMALL LETTER I is LATIN CAPITAL LETTER I WITH DOT ABOVE, not LATIN CAPITAL LETTER I like it is in ASCII). Oh, and since Unicode requires that LATIN SMALL LETTER E + COMBINING ACUTE ACCENT should be treated the same way as LATIN SMALL LETTER E WITH ACUTE, you also need to bring in the Unicode normalisation tables too.

{"prompt":"It's complicated. I like HPMOR, but... not necessarily because it's rational?\nI mean, Eliezer is an impressive writer whose style resonates with many people. And it's indeed frustrating to see idiocy in fiction, like in Star Trek where the most powerful weapon is obviously the teleporter but no one acknowledges that. We can all agree on these things.\nThe problem is that removing idiocy doesn't automatically make a piece of fiction good. It seems like Eliezer has convinced a ton of nerds (I hate the word but let's roll with it) that they can succeed in writing fiction by applying this one weird trick. But you need much more than that.\nOur enjoyment of stories comes mainly from emotions, which we then rationalize by saying \"I liked that story because the hero was really smart\". A few people have noticed that the actual plotlines in HPMOR are kinda weak, and it's really the characterization and \"epic\" style that makes the story work. A version of HPMOR that was just \"smart\", with better intrigue but less emotional appeal, wouldn't attract nearly as many people. A version of Worm without the raw moments of suffering would be kinda pointless to read. These things don't come for free if you just try to write rationally.\nTo conclude, here's a few recommendations:\n- If you want to read a work that succeeds purely based on rationality, without much emotion or characterization, check out The Metropolitan Man. It's probably the best example of its kind, and a damn good read too.\n- If you know your way around the Harry Potter universe and want another good fanfic in that setting, try The Seventh Horcrux. It doesn't give a fuck about rationality, but it's so amazing that you won't care.\n- If you want something extremely smart, well written, and emotional at the same time, read anything by Ted Chiang.

Therefore you should let everyone free ride on your platform so that fellow (broke) startups can bootstrap themselves off your prior work (good). But once said (good, broke) startups start making lots of cash, they will then become (bad) and fall into the same category of other (bad) internet giants.","completion":"People used to like, if not love Google because they were about the free and open web.  Many hackers would openly evangelize Google products and services because they were such a great company.  Moves like this make it clear that they're becoming ever more concerned with the corporate agenda (pushing G+ in this case) than the hacker spirit.\nOne issue in this specific case might be that Google has way more than enough money to keep Reader alive, whereas many people on HN see their own startups fail due to financial troubles, and if they do make it to an exit their products are often killed by acquihires.  Wealth is wasted on the wealthy and all that.\nIt feels like a betrayal because we thought Google shared our values.  Really I don't think this is about entitlement at all.  Using that word in this context amounts to shaming people about the anger they feel over a breach of trust.  Entitlement is more like having your parents fly in to demand the university raise one of your grades so you can get in to medical school."}

This means that, unless someone can convince me otherwise (and if you can, please, please convince me otherwise), Java seems to possess the correct combination of features: mature platform, wide adoption, familiar syntax, readily-available developers, maintainability by those other than the original authors (Java isn't necessarily great at this, but better than many), and a quality that I'll describe only as hard to really fuck things up too badly. If it wasn't for that last requirement, I'd already be trying to sell Python to my boss; as it stands, if I can't find some really awesome static analysis and verification tools for Python, Java is simply the only choice that my conscience allows me to make.\n(Corollary: what about .NET? Mostly I'm incredibly wary of recommending a language with only one \"blessed\" platform, and a proprietary one at that. My bosses are wary of this too: as a result of historical decisions we're currently locked into IBM hardware, writing million-line codebases in RPG-LE.

The only concern I ever had was the one of how the customer might maintain such a codebase after our contract ended, but thankfully, that isn't a significant concern as a federal IT consultant, and super-tight deadlines often precluded Java as a viable language, only to see Java as a requirement later in the same RFP - This is where Jython (and its ilk) shine beautifully.\nEdit: and just so it's said, I agree with your assessment on .Net.

{"prompt":"You cannot wield the kind of economic power Google does and not be evil, at least for the working definition many people have of \"evil\".\nWe've put a huge hunk of our intellectual and economic capital under the control of a marketing company. I really, really like Google, but I don't see this situation as being stable over a period of decades. Maybe 5-10 more years or so, but not a lot longer.\nThese kinds of decisions, where we pick economic winners and losers, are political decisions, no matter who makes them. (Personally I abhor making them, but that doesn't change what they are). These knife guys have representatives. Indeed, every small business Google has run over has democratic representation. Each year Google continues to make these decisions the political hue and cry will increase. This can't go on forever like this. \"Don't be evil\" was a great slogan, but its days are numbered. Perhaps over.\nSide note: one of the ways I can tell Google's power has grown too large is the elliptical way many commenters have of criticizing it. They're unhappy with its actions, perhaps even livid, but it's always a tone of \"Golly! This is really unfortunate and I'm sure nobody at Google really meant to do this, but....\"\nThis is the same way you'd criticize a king, somebody you are beholden to. \"Golly! I know you, the king, are not at fault, but some of these advisers of yours must have accidentally goofed up somewhere...\"\nWhereas if Dell, the electric company, or the garage down the street screws up in your eyes? Different tone entirely.","completion":"Evil is a totally relative term. Google probably thinks they are being benevolent by taking an anti-weapons stance.\nI'd be inclined to disagree..."}

BAD IDEA.\nIf you don't trust someone enough, don't get married. Period. End of story.","completion":"I don't disagree with the first part of what you are saying. The problem is that marriage is a multi-faceted agreement - a personal one, a legal one and even a spiritual one if you are so inclined.\nYour point is valid at the personal level but that doesn't negate the fact there is a legal binding contractual agreement occurring here too.  Most contracts have exit clauses and there is no reason why marriage shouldn't - especially if you are entrepreneurial and the stakes can be high upon the termination of that agreement.\nI do wonder, though, what you mean by \"If you don't trust someone enough, don't get married. Period. End of story.\", specially trust?  Trust them to do what - not divorce you or not to fleece you in the event of a divorce?\nIf it is the former, nothing is certain and marriages can fail completely through the consequences of the other half.  If the latter, well why would you hold a contract that says the other party has termination rights of x, y and z but trust them not to exercise those rights?."}
{"prompt":"I am a medical marijuana user. I have fibromyalgia (a catch all label for constant pain), and it helps some with neuropathic pain. My doctor is kept informed about how much I am using, and I have to get my card renewed each year. MJ works, but at best it dulls the pain, and also helps to make the pain less 'front and center' and instead kind of makes it more something that is in the background.\nI was never a stoner, and did not use it until I was 38 years old. I am happy it exists, because I was being treated with Vicodin for pain and was on a schedule of 6 pills a day. Enough that liver damage and addiction started to be a concern. I am allergic to pills in the Percoset family (hives and skin lesions) and I consume about 5 joints a day worth of weed. I don't even get high anymore, but it does help with the pain. It is costing me about $100 per week, compared to the $3 per month the Vicodin cost on my medical insurance. I could buy a new car with the weed money, but couldn't buy a coffee at Starbucks with the Vicodin money.\nI hope the government gets around to reclassifying the drug soon. In the current situation, Child Protective Services would take my kids away if I was to consume the drug in front of them. A reclassification would enable more research, more research would lead to easier ways to ingest it. I find food products make me stomach sick, vaporizing doesn't work as well as smoking, and smoking is unappealing and difficult to do with any discretion.\nI am fortunate that I can afford it, and can fit it into my schedule (I own my business). Many people need something like MMJ and can neither afford it, nor can they keep their employment with it because of widespread drug testing. While the state I live in says that card holders can't be fired for holding a card, it is a state that has 'right-to-work' laws and you can fire someone for no specified reason at all. (source- I employ ten people).","completion":"Interesting that you don't get high any more.

{"prompt":"This is a fair point, but it brings to mind another point I didn't really understand till the last couple of years. Learning about how compilers work is just as important. Building a small lisp compiler was a life-changing experience for me in terms of going one level deeper, as much as understanding C was. For those who've never written lisp before, the reason I recommend a lisp compiler is that lisp compilers are the simplest to write, and the most expressive in terms of runtime strategy since lisp syntax mirrors a compiler's IR (intermediate representation). I think this is just as important in todays world because languages like Ruby and Javascript are both directly inspired by lisp. We also live in a world where Clojure is seeing a steady rise, for once a Lisp with large potential for significant commercial adoption.\nI can highly recommend the book Lisp in Small Pieces, $93 on amazon, and worth every penny. Walking through the building blocks and design decisions of a language changes the way you code. Every language you look at winds up being internally translated into your own IR whether you've written a compiler or not.

The only thing I find annoying about it is that it's standard library is small which means I have to rely on third-party libraries but that I think is necessary for me to actually like it more than Python which is so huge that it just doesn't feel very fun to write anything in.

{"prompt":"My dad works in the airplane industry and had an interesting story to tell me that relates to this. (I'm not sure exactly how accurate it is or what the source is, sorry). Apparently, it is illegal for pilots to read while flying. Even if they are heading in a straight line with no one around for miles. This is because one time an pilot wasn't paying attention and due to a series of software failures, the plane turned into a mountain. Interestingly, the plane was tuning at a very exact amount so that the number of Gs remained constant.\nIn any case, this single crash caused regulation to state that computers can never fly planes by themselves. This strikes me as rather unfair. If a single human crashed a plane, it does not make it illegal for humans to fly planes by themselves.\nAnother example is that in London, subways must be driven by a human. Even though driving a subway may be trivial (there is no way to steer), Londoners apparently do not feel comfortable being driven by a non-living thing. They want to be sure that if they die, the driver dies too, adding a level of accountability.\nIt seems that this sort of wide-spread mistrust of machines is driven more by socially normal paranoia than any kind of logic. I for one am rooting for machines to take over all forms of driving.

{"prompt":"There's interesting technical content here, but it suffers from its alarmist tone.\nThe MD5 hash function is broken, that is true.

Nobody would recommend HMAC-MD5 for use in a new system, but it has not been broken.\nRC4 is horribly broken, and is horribly broken in ways that are meaningful to TLS. But the magnitude of RC4's brokenness wasn't appreciated until last year, and up until then, RC4 was a common recommendation for resolving both the SSL3\/TLS1.0 BEAST attack and the TLS \"Lucky 13\" M-t-E attack. That's because RC4 is the only widely-supported stream cipher in TLS. Moreover, RC4 was considered the most computationally efficient way to get TLS deployed, which 5-6 years ago might have been make-or-break for some TLS deployments.\nYou should worry about RC4 in TLS --- but not that much: the attack is noisy and extremely time consuming. You should not be alarmed by MD5 in TLS, although getting rid of it is one of many good reasons to drive adoption of TLS 1.2.","completion":"But moving from AES and SHA to RC4 and MD5 should have made a few bells go if simply because it is bad engineering and shows lack of knowledge.\nIf we want to move away from MD5 and RC4 we first must start deprecating their usage wherever we can.

It is common knowledge (here) that the air filters on diesel engines need time (~15 minutes) to properly warm up to be able to burn off the soot in the filter. Therefore, only the traditional fleet cars who are driven by salesmen driving long stretches on the Autobahn tend to buy diesels.\nWas this also the same in the US, because many of my friends that own diesels in the UK had never heard of this?","completion":"In the 1970s, General Motors (possibly irreparably) ruined the market for diesel automobiles in the USA.

Rickshaw failed me in this regard. I have a caching scheme in my client-side application.

I bought my last car via www.drivethedeal.com, and wound up saving about 1\/6 of the best quote I was getting from the local dealerships, which itself wasn't offensive. As far as I can tell, they did it by singling out one dealership in the entire UK that was willing to sell for very narrow, if any, margins, but then generated enough volume for that one dealership that presumably they qualified for perks from the manufacturers or similar.\nI offered the local dealers the chance to match the price, but after hearing the figure I'd been quoted, they politely declined. They claimed that they would actually lose money on the sale if they did, and while I'm not an expert on the UK new car market, I suspect given the size of the discount that the local guys were being honest there.\nCaution: That was mid-2000s, so any recommendation for that particular deal site is stale.

We agree on that I'm sure. But so does a web browser. So does the operating system it runs on.

JavaScript lets me to do that, but I'm afraid that if you disable JavaScript from today forward you're going to run into this a lot more.\nIt doesn't take a whole ton of JavaScript to supercharge a CSS layout, but if you block all JS you're going to be looking at a broken page.\nI use text-mode browsers on the command-line, and for checking the source of pages from the command-line so I understand when there's a time and place for restricted browsing and it's less useful than a full browser to me because of it.\nHaving said all that, would you mind explaining why you choose to break your exerience of the web by disabling JavaScript, and what gains you perceive from the exercise.

This means you have to implement them yourself, on the fly, for the given type when you need it. This does increase the time it takes to implement something, but also can introduce a lot of bugs as well - you can't rely on (almost guaranteedly) bug free implementations of existing functions.\nOf course this runs much deeper than just the list type, but on day-to-day basis I feel this to be the biggest pain.

It's a critique of a pundit. And it's a pundit who wears his bias on his sleeve. It's boring. People don't read Gruber for the unvarnished truth about the mobile market. If you want to right whatever wrong you feel is being committed because a gifted writer has overtly taken Apple's side (gasp!), write an excellent blog advocating for the Google ecosystem. But don't waste our time litigating against Gruber. Nobody cares!","completion":"If second-order punditry is so worthless, why are we content to spout third-order punditry here?"}

{"prompt":"> For instance: center-left party gets 48% of the vote, communists (they still exist here) get 4% of the vote. To form a majority, the large party must strike a deal with the small party, which can dictate conditions...\nOr they simply look for someone on the other side. E.g. in Germany, SPD (social democrats) routinely ignore Left (socialists and communists) and instead deals with the conservative CDU. It's not like they have only one alternative, nor like they need a majority to form a government in most countries with PR.\nI don't see this as a downside. If you only get 48%, you don't even have a mandate from a majority of voters. It is only fair that you will need to negotiate with other parties to adjust how you govern to the benefit of a larger part of the population. For that matter, this shouldn't just change at 50% either - having parties representing 50% + 1 dictate policy still leaves half the population subject to the whims of a narrow majority.\n> Another flaw is that, in Italy at least, since it is not the voters of a given district who decide on one of several candidates, it is the political party who decides who actually gets to be on the list of people sent to parliament. This gives a lot of power to the political party itself, and whoever controls it.\nWhy is this a flaw? If voters are not happy with the candidates that are nominated, they can a) join the party and vote for other candidates during nomination, or b) vote for a different party (or form one...). With proportional representation the barrier to starting a new party with a chance of taking a seat is much lowered, and it is fairly common in European politics for candidates that does not get the support of their party to get a list together as an independent and win a seat. Sometimes that even ends up forming the basis of a new party.","completion":"It sounds nice, but in places like Israel you end up with governments headed by a party that took just about a 15% mandate, coalescing with two partners that took a 13% mandate and a shit-ton of small single-issue parties that got something like 3% each.

Obviously it won't happen overnight, but at least they have a shot at it with Android.\nThey'll never do it with WP8. The math just doesn't add up. They'll always be limited by the WP ecosystem and the WP market share. Samsung has 30% of the smartphone market, which is about 40% of the Android market share.\nNokia will have at most 50% of the WP market share. It only has more now because the market is very tiny, but that would change if WP market grew. That means that for Nokia to beat Samsung, WP will need to get to 60% of the smartphone market share, and it means beating Android in market share. WP will never get that much market share, and even the most optimistic (and I believe, unrealistic) predictions by research firms put WP at 20% - 5 years from now.\nSo if Nokia wants to stop being more than a niche smartphone player in the future, they'll have no choice but to at least also adopt Android. It's the right strategy for the Nokia board to pick. They just seem to be very stubborn about it, just like they were too stubborn to fire the Nokia CEO before Elop, for 4 years after the iPhone launched.

One of the two needs to happen.","completion":"While that might be good for Nokia (I am not personally convinced), it brings nothing to the consumers except another shiny vehicle for Google's OS.\nEven with being open-source Android is almost impossible to use securely and privately. From Google to every minor app developer everyone is trying to syphon data. \nOne can install CM, but the permission system is still broken and the moment you install gapps over it one cannot even save contacts locally any more. I could go on, but my conclusion was that it's not worth the bother to try and get Android to be more respectful of one's information, it is designed to do the opposite.\nSo, no thanks from me. The market needs fresh ideas, not the same semi-open OS with a nicer Nokia camera."}

After all, the Nuremburg trials punished people for violating laws that didn't exist during the commission of the crimes. If Manning had, say, only released extremely strong evidence of war crimes, I might agree that hiding that evidence was itself unlawful. But he didn't--he released a giant trove of classified diplomatic cables and military logs. These may have been unnecessarily classified, but were not unlawfully classified.

They now have significantly more economic power than their parents had, at least within their country.\nThat would seem to be less true in nation B - person B might have observed their objective wealth to have increased similarly to person A, but they have been less able to change their relative status in the world and are  less able to move up any ladder-based system (I propose that land ownership\/housing is typically one such system) and are more dependent on factors outside of their control."}

These people are essentially AA ambassadors who have paid for the privilege. How much does AA spend on marketing? How does it compare to the cost of these AAirpass holders? I bet these people otherwise sing AA's praises.\nAlso, what is the fill rate on first class seats on flights? I think part of the point of first class seats is they don't fill up giving premier passengers the ability to buy tickets on short notice.

I don't know how much the marginal cost of a seat on a flight to London is, but it's a hell of a lot less than retail.

{"prompt":"Here's an IDE idea: create an industry standard plugin protocol. Most of the cool stuff an IDE does is code analysis and transformation e.g. refactoring, error analysis, and autofill. The other half is \"makes coding pretty\", \"provides good shortcuts\", and other UI considerations.\nNow for the latter - that is great, and everyone has different strengths and weaknesses. And that is just a UX issue.\nFor the former however, I don't know why I need to use different IDEs for different languages, or even different IDEs for different transforms to the same codebase in the same language (again, for the automated bits).\nIt would be so much better for the world if there was some common protocol between user environment and code transformer. That way I could buy some of JetBrains awesome plugins and have my trusty Vim or Emacs environments use them. I could just keep using IntelliJ with MS' plugins for C# (and resharper of course). And so on.\nFor stuff that really needs a special UI, we are in the age of the web browser. Provide a localhost server in your tool and make the reports etc live in a browser window, big GUI IDEs can provide a webkit that can link back to their own editors, but text editor users could still get the useful output.\nThis \"everyone does their own thing\" without even pretending interoperability is getting old. We've been doing this coding thing for a little while now - we should be better at tooling that plays nice.","completion":"I'm with you on the interoperability, if anyone in the world should understand and be 100% completely behind that, it should be coders and makers of code tools.

Just a rebranding?","completion":"To the extent that it's a new umbrella term that mostly encompasses a set of techniques that have been around for a couple decades now, yeah, it's just a rebranding.\nBut I think the rebranding makes some sense because it calls attention to a common characteristic shared by all the techniques that fall under the brand: They tend to learn their own feature transformations, which is cool because it means you don't have to put nearly so much effort into figuring out how to curate the input."}

{"prompt":"I'm a medical student who actually read the paper this article refers to. I would be very careful trying to draw conclusions from a study like this. I don't think many people in the healthcare community would be very surprised by it.\n1) All clinically treated hypertensive patients were excluded - that means if you have kidney or vascular disease (hypertension) and are being treated for it, you aren't counted here. Doctors WILL care about your salt intake if you have these conditions, as they should! It is very common to prescribe something called the DASH diet to lower sodium intake and increase potassium intake.\n2) If you're healthy, it means your kidneys are healthy (simplifying). One of the purposes of the kidneys is to maintain homeostatic blood pressure by excreting a combination of salt and water. To put it simply, if you eat a huge load of NaCl, say in a dominoes pizza, your blood pressure WILL NOT be affected for a very long time. I'd guess 20 minutes or so after the salt enters your bloodstream. Which means these folks can't measure that blood pressure change by testing blood pressure yearly.\n3) Either medical doctors or the press that listens to them have a nasty habit of taking treatments that often work for very sick people - morbidly obese, type 1 diabetics, bed-ridden centenarians - and applying it to normal healthy folks. I will go out on a limb and say that these unilateral recommendations are almost all BS, and should be ignored. If you're healthy: eating eggs will not affect your cholesterol, eating cheesecake will not give you diabetes, sitting in a chair will not misalign your spine. It would be prudent for you to be skeptical when you hear these claims, often on daytime television or on the internet.","completion":"Yep. For many years, I have thought the data has been pointing to potassium deficiency in normal folks. With kidney issues, just as you said. Even with a very healthy diet, the large majority miss the RDA in potassium. Good to see the medical professionals slowly turn towards this conclusion (slowly is likely good, BTW)."}

Using something like Sublime, I never think, man, if only Sublime did x, it would save me five minutes, twenty times a week!\nI've never had anyone explain to me what specific kind of code editing is so much more productive in vim than in any other editor. Can someone give me a real-world, commonly occurring example?\nOr is it not about productivity? Is it an interface thing? People like the way it feels to use? The article explains the \"feeling\" I always hear about, how vim is so much better, but for the millionth time, fails to tell me why, in a way a non-vim-user can understand.","completion":"For me, it's about the interface. In descending order: intuitive, consistent, modular, comfortable, portable.\nIntuitive: most commands resemble natural language, without awkward or arbitrary mappings. For instance:\n- w: (forward) word;\n- cw: change  (forward) word;\n- c2w: change 2  (forward) words;\n- 2cw: twice change word;\n- ciw: change inner word;\nThere is no intervening translation. For instance, to change a word in mainstream editors, you delete it first, then start entering the new text. In Vim, it's one command: you think \"change forward word\", you issue the \"change forward word\" command.\nConsistent. For instance, double letters work on lines:\n- cc: change line;\n- dd: delete line;\n- yy: yank line;\nand capital letters work till the end of the line:\n- C: change till the end of the line;\n- D: delete till the end of the line;\n- Y: yank till the end of the line (not so in vanilla Vim, but I've remapped it because consistency matters to me).\nModular: you compose commands. For instance, \/ is the search command and then:\n- d\/testo: delete until the next occurrence of \"testo\";\n- c\/testo: change until the next occurrence of \"testo\";\n- etc.\nComfortable: limited usage of modifier keys. Vim saved me from RSI.\nPortable: letters and Shift keys are in the same position on any keyboard, be it on a desktop, a laptop, etc.  whilst each laptop manufactures has its own idea about where Control, Alt, Arrows, PageUp and PageDown should be.\nHope this helps."}

Stop creating shitty startups that look amazing.\n> It is to a massive degree much, much easier to spend a week pushing pixels to create something beautiful\n> If there\u2019s one thing you can rely on everyone having an opinion on, it\u2019s how something should look.\n(my emphasis)\nThe author's conniption would appear to be around graphic design. Graphic design is a subset of design, and covers nothing close to the full scope of what goes into the design of a new product. Design is about how things work and, often, what feelings they evoke in the process. How they look can be a part of that, but it needn't always be.\nFor example: how delightful is it to work with a great API? Something straightforward, well-documented, but nonetheless powerful? It's such a joy. But it requires effort: planning, understanding, experimentation, adjustment, refining, etc. In a word, design.\nAs a test, consider the following:\nIs it first engine design or is it engine making? Airframe design or airframe building? Circuit design or circuit assembly? You can't make the engine until someone designs it first. How it looks doesn't much matter \u2013 how it works is non-negotiably essential.\nSomething that works well is said to be well-designed. Something that merely looks nice can be pretty \u2013 and terribly designed.\nSo a startup can't have something be both shitty and well-designed at the same time.\nThe notion that design is a differentiating characteristic for startups comes from the fact that many incumbent products simply do not work well. By designing a product that addresses a given workflow faster, with greater convenience, with greater fun, you're making something that works better.\nWe're past the point where you can build technology that fits requirements and stop there. Everyone else has done that already. Now success comes in making things that are satisfying, not obnoxious, that are easily learned, that make users excited to show their friends.\ntl;dr: Someone doesn't grasp the difference between design and making nice graphics, throws a tantrum of a non-sequitur.","completion":"> We're past the point where you can build technology that fits requirements and stop there.

{"prompt":"> One theory is that Mt. Gox became fractional reserve some time in the past, either by losing bitcoins or by spending them.\nMaybe pedantic, but many people have been using fractional reserve wrt Mt Gox lately.  The usual meaning of that term:  A bank will loan out deposits, reserving a fraction for withdrawals.  However, a key point is that the bank holds collateral against the loan, and that collateral has a fair-market value, so the balance sheet is still positive.  (A major problem in the housing meltdown was that the value of the collateral dropped, making many banks technically insolvent.)\nWhat Mt Gox did is take money from depositors and either lose or spend them.  That's just either bad business (if they lost them) or fraud (if they spent them).  Calling it \"fractional reserve\" gives it an air of legitimacy that they really do not deserve.\nEdit:  I did not intend to start a discussion on the finer points of bank accounting.  The major point is:  To my knowledge, Gox wasn't trying to make loans with money that deposited with them, which is what a fractional reserve business is.","completion":"\"making many banks technically insolvent\"\nMy understanding is that few banks were actually made insolvent, but that lots had to eat fire-sale prices due to liquidity issues.

They simply aren't co-related, at least not as far as we can tell from most leading posts about hiring on HN.\nSo if the goal is efficiency, why not just hire people based on their IQ? What else is there that qualifies people for positions where their bosses 2 levels up have no idea how they're actually executing the work that's put in front of them, and rely completely on them to come to the best logical solutions to new problems creatively, quickly and every single time? The only other standard you might want to look for is trustworthiness, but you can't measure that in an interview.\nAnyway, it doesn't matter if someone with 140+ IQ has ever coded before. It's probably worth paying to train them. So let's just cut to the chase.

So in judging the scale of their guilt you have to consider a subset of morality.\nBecause if you're TechCrunch and you are deciding what to do with these documents you have to accept an immoral thing is going to happen.  So the question for them becomes: Is it immoral to cheat your employees out of the revenue this information would generate because you want to stick to a moral code that you know will have no consequence?\nThat doesn't excuse what they did but it's a mitigating factor.

{"prompt":"People who are really good at their jobs obsess about their tools- artists obsess over their paint, carpenters obsess over their power tools, cooks obsess over their knives.\nPHP is like buying a chef's knife at Wal-Mart. You can create a 5 star dish with it, it cuts perfectly fine, but it doesn't inspire the same passion that a Shun knife does.\nMost restaurants in fact, don't use fancy-knives, they use just regular knives and it works out just fine.\nBut, to draw the analogy back to programming, we're not regular restaurants. We're wannabe \"rock-star\" chefs- coding and \"startup-ing\" isn't just a job, it's part of our core ethos, so we obsess over all the tools we use, the text editor, the monitor, even the chair- because it makes the experience all that much better.\nMost people do this about things they seriously care about. Runners debate intricacies of running shoes or the perfect in race meal. I've had debates with weight-lifters about weight-lifting gloves. Go over to a different forum, and you will hear arguments about the perfect size of a suit lapel.\nThe \"Everyman\" tools can always accomplish 100% of the job, but provide 90% of the experience. We spend an inordinate amount of time trying to get that last 10% out.\nIs it probably unnecessary? Yeah. But people really bond over passions, and in arguing\/debating that last 10%, you can really connect with people, which is why sites like Hacker News are fun and addictive.","completion":"That's fine if you're starting a project or a business from scratch.

{"prompt":"The simplicity and flexibility of Excel make it great for one-offs and random hack jobs that don't require a new application or full-fledged report. At the same time, it has some minor idiosyncrasies that can be infuriating and make me wary of trusting it in the hands of average end-users who need to enter\/analyze important data.\nAutomatic type conversion is my favorite. I can't even count the number of times I've received Excel spreadsheets where data was completely lost because of it. Leading zeroes at the beginning of your account number? Excel will gladly chop those off for you. Order number looks like a date because they used the year as a prefix? No worries, Excel will change that to a standard date and completely forget the original format.\nMaybe I'm just crazy, but I don't think a business-oriented application should favor convenience that much more than data integrity.","completion":"Depending on how you want to use the data, you may be able to get around this problem by adding a ' infront of the number. It won't show on the cell display and acts as an instruction to hold leading zeros."}
{"prompt":"I'm skeptical of this unnamed company's actual abilities. In the initial email how are they able to identify anything about your visitors before you've installed the tracking code? Since they apparently can see search terms used to reach your site the only thing I can think of is their code is running on some site that links to you (perhaps an off-brand search engine?) and they're tracking outbound clicks. Or it's fake.\nIt's pretty easy to guess company name from IP address, especially if you don't care about accuracy. You can kinda sorta do this in Google Analytics under Audience > Technology > Network. That seems to be roughly what they're doing in the screenshots posted. IMHO, this is not the most serious privacy issue on the web.\nI would be very curious to hear exactly what percentage of visitors it is able to supply Name and Email for (and how many of those fields look bogus). This sort of individual-level tracking across sites is obviously possible, but I don't think it's common. Google\/DoubleClick do not, as far as I know, do any sort of tracking at the level of an individual's name or email address (And why would they? It's asking for regulatory problems and it doesn't really help them much -- they target ads to groups of similar people based on demographics, not to particular named individuals.)","completion":"The initial email comes with what it calls a mock example. I think that's what you're referring to."}
{"prompt":"I must be missing something basic here: If someone refinances their student loan, that means they get a loan from someone and uses the proceeds from that loan to pay the federal government back the balance on their student loan, right? So they're saying that people paying back their student loans will cost the paxpayers money?  That makes no sense -- me paying the loan back means the taxpayers are no longer at risk for the balance of my loan.","completion":"What's happening is that lenders are saying \"we'll pay back your loan and offer you a lesser interest rate\". So they pay the government the 200,000 you owe at 6.9% APR and then send you a bill for the 200,000 with a 4.4% APR. The USG loses all the interest since everything is paid back immediately and these lenders pocket your 4.4% APR. It seems like a win win win for everyone since the government gets paid back everything, the student has a lower interest rate, and the lender pockets the 4.4% annually but when there are so many lenders doing this it essentially cheats the USG out of all interest they'd earn on these loans."}
{"prompt":"I don't get this trend at all. Something is wrong with priorities and perceived risk vs. real risk.\nIt's pretty difficult to assault someone physically over the internet (http:\/\/bash.org\/?4281).

Will x years from now we all be walking in some kind of uniform enclosures as to protect from anyone knowing if one is male or female?\nAlso, in some languages name is very clear indication of the gender. And even some ambiguous nickname won't help, because in some languages you usage of verbs, adjectives etc. differs depending on gender.\nRecently I saw a story about some kindergarden in Sweden where kids were not allowed to say \"he\" or \"she\" when talking about person but rather had to use something equivalent to \"it\" (I don't think English has equivalent to that, Russian language has \"\u043e\u043d\u043e\" for neuter nouns).\nTo me it looks extremely stupid. But I guess it is easier just to ignore our differences than teach to cherish them and respect the other side.","completion":"Lets propose that you have a child, and in your wisdom, decide that letting your child roam on the streets is low risk and thus ok.\nDo you then proclaim to everyone that they must let their children roam alone on the streets as the real risk is low?\nWhat is important is people have a choice to act on their perceived risks. In your example, the ability to wear clothes to hide their gender is their choice, it is not imposed on them.\nIn this case, they do not have a choice that is sufficiently suitable."}

{"prompt":"The problem with verbosity and repetition is not that it takes longer to type the code, at all. The problem is that it creates dependencies which you have to manage by hand.\nChanging `Foo a = new Foo()` to `Bar a = new Bar()` doesn't seem that bad... except when you have to propagate that change through the code base. Half of Java's tooling is dedicated to solving a problem that doesn't exist in good duck-typed languages or those with type inference.\nVerbosity is also a warning sign for lack of expressive power. If you have a pattern like `if (cmd == \"run\") run();` in multiple places in your codebase, you want to make it so that changing one changes them all. Java won't let you factor this out easily, but worse, it won't catch you when you make a mistake (better languages will either do first-class functions or pattern matching and exhaustiveness checks).\nNote that this has nothing to do with static vs. dynamic; verbosity is a problem that can be solved in many ways, but it is a problem. The author also spends a lot of time equating statically typed with fast; well, there are plenty of very fast dynamic languages.\nThere certainly are reasons to like Java, but these aren't them.","completion":"In the strongly typed language Scala you get the same benefits as in the duck type languages, and even better :-) You can do:\n  val usersById = HashMap[UserId, User]()\n\nif elsewhere you have defined: `type UserId = String`.

{"prompt":"Few thoughts:\n> and opened the decibel meter on my iPhone\nThese are notoriously inaccurate. To get accurate decibel readings, the mic must be calibrated to absolute known levels (something your App can't do). The App's are basically just comparing relative sounds (this sound is more prominent than this other one, and therefore must be louder... after establishing some relative baseline). Real decibel measuring equipment is very expensive and requires re-calibration routinely. So, measuring 80db could easily be in a swing of +\/- 10db's (or more).\n> 150dB: Jet take-off at 25 meters (eardrum rupture)\nThat's not quite accurate. Long term exposure could lead to damage over time, but for comparison a shotgun is typically measured at 165db when it's up against your shoulder and face. Yes, you wear hearing protection (nick-named \"ears\" if you are a frequent shooter) but your eardrumps aren't rupturing immediately if you take them off.\n> What shocked me was the volume of the PA system\nYes, it's loud -- by design. The PA system is not there just to provide something to listen to in case you are bored. In a best case scenario, it's there for the usual \"buckle-up\" talk and for the pilot to give a greeting. In the worst case scenario, it's there for emergency instructions (a time when panic and passenger noises are likely to get quite loud on their own).","completion":"definitely true on the inaccuracy.\nhowever, in the absence of anything else it is an indication."}

It must mean the modal time or something like that.\"\nI contributed that this is an issue in defining average wind directions, as well.  The basic problem is that if you record times on a 0-24 hour scale, or wind directions on a 0-360 degree scale, and then naively average the numbers, you get meaningless results (for example, 180 degrees if the wind steadily rotates through every point of the compass).\nA quick glance at our doctor friend showed she had checked out of the conversation entirely.  Possibly she just felt slighted that we were not bowing down in awe at the terrible hours she keeps.

It does mean that the measurer and the measured have to be the same person, or people working closely together.","completion":"I think part of the \"feeling\" is knowing - internally - how much you have learned during that particular programming session.

{"prompt":"\"No interface\" actually means \"no mobile phone interface\". Let's not kid ourselves... interface is still important.\nTake the author's critical example of a smartphone app to unlock your car. Yes, that's terrible. Now, let's look at the actual interface - the key. I've owned two Subarus now. I loved the keyless entry device on my 1999 Outback. I feel the keyless entry on my 2010 Forester was a step backwards. I accidentally trigger it when I don't want to. It's unreliable, often taking several presses to work. It adds an extra button I've never used that is redundant functionality.\nHow about another interface? We recently got a new turkey baster, made by Good Grips. It has a built-in rest. Turkey basters get greasy-dirty, and you keep using them off and on for hours. The rest keeps it from getting grease all over your counter. That's a great user interface!\nThe problem isn't \"no interface\". The problem is \"there's an app for that\". Not everything falls under smartphone convenience. That doesn't mean it doesn't have a UI.","completion":"Well, no. I think this example show that the best interface is no graphical interface. If the key of my car were some physical button or combination on my phone it would be better than real keys. Real keys are better than an app because I can feel then in my pocket, take them out and own the door, fire the engine without looking at them.\nActually all terminal, vin, emacs, got, etc users here probably agree: best interface for advanced interaction with complex system is still the console. I would configure and program and repair my futuristic car from a remote keyboard and black screen. Then it will open the doors by nfc when my phone is close enough. And if on the move, I'll reprogram it from a term app in my phone."}
{"prompt":"So here's the part about this that deeply disturbs me.\nIt's reasonable to assume at this point that Mozilla's next CEO will have their political opinions thoroughly vetted, overtly or covertly. In fact, it's reasonable to assume this will become a higher priority at all tech companies. Who wants to be the next Mozilla, after all?  You pretty much have to do this now.\nAnd that's an awful place for us to be. It's going to go too far, because these things always do. Once you make something a corporate risk, corporations go too far in reducing it. So we're going to get the blandest, most milquetoast candidates possible. And it's going to hurt people on all sides of the political spectrum.\nIt's also going to make people with ambitions of CEOhood hold back from any political support of anything, liberal or  conservative or whatever.\nThere's a definite chilling effect at work here. An internet mob has forced out a major company's CEO over a political issue.\nYes, for many it's more than just politics. But that's not my point. My point is that it's also a political issue, and that's the lesson that's corporations are going to take here. They aren't going to limit it to issues some people see as human rights issues, they're going to apply it to all  political issues, because overcompensating is what large corporations do.\nIt's worrying, and ultimately a step in the wrong direction.","completion":"The thing is, all this is decidedly not against anybody's rights.

{"prompt":"Exactly my feeling. My thesis is that FSF achieved its popularity in the heyday of Microsoft monopoly serving as a counter-force, and as Microsoft's hegemony declined (thanks in part to FSF's efforts), it has become less relevant. Open source (I intentionally do not want to use Stallman's language on this) is thriving but FSF is not.\nGPL is way too dogmatic, and given the fact that most free software actually is written by people with a paycheck from those hated proprietary software companies (at any rate, companies that definitely do not buy into FSF dogma), there always has been an underlying tension between their philosophy and the vast majority of contributors to open source. Basically Stallman wants them to feel dirty getting that paycheck.\nAs a result, we are moving to a different phase in the open source world - focus on code, not on the politics.\nI want to add an illustration of the perverse effects GPL produced in practice. MySQL - now in the hands of Larry Ellison ... there must be some irony there -  perfectly shows how to use GPL in a very \"interesting\" way. I have dealt with MySQL salesmen on several occasions, so I know how they \"use\" GPL. Basically they would assert with full confidence that your use-case (whatever it may be) would violate GPL, so you have to pony up unless you want all your code to be GPL. They knew how to exploit \"GPL fear\" in companies, but would back down in most cases once you bring a lawyer.\nThat is the practical real world effect of dogma. My prediction: MySQL will be orphaned intentionally by Oracle. No one else is going to touch it because forking the MySQL code will not let anyone escape the famous Oracle salesmen.","completion":"We use MySQL at work. After a major infrastructural change I think I'll be able to get us to move to Postgres. It might depends on whether or not we have any fires to put out at that point but we'll see. Postgres is better supported by the framework we're moving to. shrugs\nI'm not sure what, if any, contributions I can make to this cause. When I have anything worth releasing, I try to release BSD, but I'd really like to be able to contribute to llvm. I don't know that I necessarily have any skills that would be useful to them.\nGPLv3 is horridly dogmatic. A great number of the old hackers are on some kind of corporate payroll, frequently Red Hat.\nI'm not certain I'm 100% comfortable with the current corporate patronage system because it has allowed people like Ulrich Drepper to dig out his private little Hell with glibc and torment anyone who begs a moment of his time."}

It gets easier to move into that relaxed state of awareness the more I walk, and I come out of it feeling refreshed and invigorated.\nOne note: I've found that comfortable walking shoes really help.

We're speaking about 5% of the original (pre-Nokia acquisition) workforce. You must know whether you're in the bottom 5%, or if your product is in the least critical 5%. Of course there are surprises and some good\/productive guys will be laid off because of politics (as the process is not completely effective), but in general that's not the case.\nI've seen similar things happening inside the financial industry around 2008.

{"prompt":"Parenscript, a javascript generator, eh?\nI don't understand, why would anyone want to generate javascript from S-exprs? I understand this is fashionable in the CL world, but I've never seen any good justification for this practice outside of saying, \"Now everything is in lisp.\"\nBut this isn't a terribly compelling argument. Most web applications are multi-language and it doesn't seem terribly detrimental to them. Further, the state of the art in web technology moves so incredibly fast that it seems strange and almost obstructionist to insist on a secondary library that needs to be kept in synch.\nFinally, it tends to lead to crap designs. Anyone who does cross-browser implementations designs will tell you that simple CSS over a generic HTML framework is almost never enough. Frequently you need to introduce new enclosing scopes or add seemingly senseless markup to help make IE play nice (a torturous exercise many web designers still need to go through). So while CL has some awesome web libraries, I'd say their extensive work into making HTML+JS+CSS generation from pure lisp seems like a foundation built on sand. Sometimes I wonder if the whole exercise was just to avoid working with HTML, which many (more prejudiced) developers find distasteful to work with.\nI don't think Clojure is at a significant disadvantage to CL in this field. If anything, it's at an advantage in web applications, as it has access to a massive number of very good web-related and utility libraries. A paucity of modern, battle tested libraries that \"work everywhere\" has always been Common Lisp's achilles heel.","completion":"Good points, KD.  Clearly, you've been there.

What the article is doing is comparing the 40 year return at 7% to a 40 year return at 7% minus 2% management fees, and noting that your total return in the second case is about half as much as your total return in the second case.\nOf course all that tells you is that it's stupid to pay 2% management fees if you can get the same return with lower management fees. That's obvious. Whether you can get the same return by yourself is a separate issue. Now, in the long run, your typical investor is going to get the same return (pre-fees) with active management with 2% fees as he does with an index fund at 0.1% fees, hence he's going to come out ahead using an index fund. But at least in theory what Wall Street is selling you here is better return than what you could make on an index fund.\nIn a way, it's the same as every other product that drives the modern economy. They're selling you an idea (in this case, that active management will yield higher returns). In reality, its the same cheap Chinese crap everyone else is selling.","completion":"\"Of course all that tells you is that it's stupid to pay 2% management fees if you can get the same return with lower management fees.\"\nIt is a bit more nuanced than that, basically it's saying you don't have any control over what sort of fee structure your 401k has in place, and goes on to suggest that banks abuse that lack of control.

{"prompt":"All of this is absolutely true. But what we need for the idea of basic income to take off is a positive rationale for it, as opposed to a negative one of the 'if we don't we're fucked' kind. The reason this matters is that the disruption won't be overnight, so you're looking at more of aobiling-frog scenario where the pace of job loss is slow enough that politicians can blame it on other sources for a while, like whoever is in the White House at the time, furriners taking our jawbs, workers being too lazy to retrain...basically the same bullshit we've heard over most of the last decade as an excuse not to engage with the deeper structural problems in our economy. Politicians excel at this; look at how Japan has been in an economic stall for 20 or so years, with politicians tinkering round the edges and shying away from fundamental change, because opportunist opponents can leverage change to mobilize political power by making empty promises.\nThe problem is that a basic income to (say) the 150m people in the civilian labor force x the ~$23k poverty line income would be about $3.4 trillion, which is not far off the entire federal government budget. That's (very roughly) $10,000 worth of redistribution for everyone in the country, which is going to be an incredibly tough sell politically, for reasons that I hope are obvious.\nPeople in general are terrible at doing sensible things to stave off a distant-seeming catastrophe, viz the relatively poor progress on lowering\/mitigating\/managing the effects of climate change (whether or not you believe it's humanity's fault) or any number of other topics.\nI do agree with the writer's conclusion and reasoning, I'm just pessimistic about our ability to manage the accelerating pace of disruption.","completion":"Indeed - the left needs a unifying story.

Why would a McDonald's have security people looking for cameras?  Possibly because it was a mafia front.

But there are other less dramatic things they might be doing besides money laundering: using undocumented labor, for example.","completion":"Franchise restaurants are terrible avenues for money laundering because of all the internal controls put in place by the parent company. Cash registers are linked directly back to central servers under control of the parent company, so that the franchisee does not gain an opportunity to skim on the revenue share that is passed back up.\nThe same tight controls put in place by the parent org to assure they receive their full revenue share, and so that they can monitor store sales, inventory demand, and all the other good things that come with instant centralized sales info etc. etc. also prevent money laundering as a side effect.\nFurther, both McDonalds stores on the Champs-Elysees are corporate owned and operated. McDonalds in France has a high rate of corporate store ownership and operation compared to other countries (20% in France compared to 15% globally) because of a previous bad experience with the national franchisee (it was fought out in a court battle[1]) and that store being a marquee store for the brand in Europe.\nMy only theory as to why this happen is that the staff were confronted with a situation that they were not accustomed to dealing with and that caused them to react poorly. McDonalds is a highly controversial company and because of their profile they are constantly being targeted by individuals, groups and the media (see 'supersize me', 'fast food nation', 'mclibel' etc.).

It's not reasonable to place the blame on one of the few companies that provided an out and had it thrown squarely back in their face.

Clearly, if antonyms indicate the same thing to me, then I'm the one who's wrong, but it's still surprising to me.\nThe only phrase that would make me think Monday is, I think, \"push the meeting up.\" But, while I would think Friday if it was \"push the meeting back,\" the phrase \"push the meeting down\" sounds nonsensical to me.\nThis is why natural language processing is hard.","completion":"Meeting times are much more often moved farther into the future than closer to the present. Thus it's quite natural many people will see \"forward [on the calendar]\" and \"back [further away from here and now]\" as meaning the same thing in this context.\nThat is: it's easier to mentally toggle between calendar-orientation-metaphor and the receding-in-front-of-us-metaphor -- between which 'forward' and 'back' are not necessarily opposites -- than to toggle interpretation to the less-common situation where a meeting is moved earlier.\nIf you want to unambiguously declare a meeting is coming sooner, saying it's \"moved up\" currently works. In that case the traditional calendar- or even dayplanner- orientation predominates, whether it's moved up in days or hours.\n(Online text may eventually change that: blogs and activity streams increasingly make down-the-past and up-the-future, with new items in some sense 'dropping in' from above the viewport.

Are there no studies of this?\nAs one personal data point, I drink 2-4 cups daily and a few months ago I decided to suddenly stop just to see what happens. The results were very unexciting: I felt nothing. No headaches, no fogginess, no significant loss of alertness (although I did need more time to \"warm up\" in the morning from my groggy morning states). Otherwise I felt normal and after a week of unexciting I just went back to drinking coffee because it tastes good and works when you need it.\nAt least from my personal study then, it seems 2-4 cups daily is not enough to get any adverse effects.","completion":"Instant coffee will give you roughly 12mg of caffeine, an espresso will give you ~150mg , a regular size cup of brewed coffee from somewhere like Starbucks is around ~200mg of caffeine.\nThe strength of your coffee is in the brewing method and beans used.

As far as I know they are all related to google services(Someone please correct me if I'm wrong).  Their store, their maps, their email, their location services.  This isn't needed in the open source distro and it works great without them.  Also there are a lot of restriction on the brand and how you use it when release an Android product.  That isn't unique to Android.  See firefox vs iceweasel.\nSure sometimes it gets annoying that a lot of Android design decisions are made behind closed doors and in working in the framework sometimes I have to play the game of \"Guess what the Google engineer was thinking\" because documentation can be scarce.  Also from what I've heard sending changing upstream isn't an easy process.  These things are nice and make it an easy product to work with... but aren't required for it to be truly open source.  The code is there in a series of open git repos and under Apache license.  That is open source in my book.","completion":"Exactly - and isn't the Kindle Fire OS a successful Android fork?"}
{"prompt":"As a member of the Chrome security team and one of the original instigators for this experiment, yes the whole point is to prevent phishing. The fact is that phishing is one of the most common attack vectors for most people, and the way the URL is currently displayed does very little to protect them. So, we're experimenting with ways of displaying the essential information (origin and TLS state) as clearly as possible, while removing the components that are not security relevant and are currently being abused to trick users.\nNo one has any intention of diminishing usability or making it hard manipulate URLS. The team working on this is still actively refining things and studying what works and what doesn't. But, phishing is a very big problem, and this change to the omnibox shows real promise in countering the attacks. So, I think we would be remiss in not pursuing the investigation further.","completion":"As a developer, if this is going to hide any useful information on first glance I am not sure how I feel about that. I already feel like Chrome has started shunning developers with that over the top annoying pop-up any time I open a new window (Ctrl+N, type, stop typing because I have to move my mouse to close the popup), and moving towards forcing developers to distribute their extensions through the play store (which kills any small-time extensions for tiny communities & friends).\nI appreciate trying to make Chrome more secure, but please don't forget about the developers.

(This is how they do it in the UK and UK people are very happy with their internet service.)\nIn this case you get a choice of different middle miles and different television services from different providers.

{"prompt":"I'm glad that they're finally coming around to the realization that Wikipedia has become increasingly closed to new contributions, and that they've stopped touting the (patently absurd) hypothesis that new users just don't \"get it.\" (The fact that they'd even think, let alone think first, to blame the users is just a giant head-scratcher).\nAs a simple UX experiment, I would ask new users this: try to contribute substantively to any article on Wikipedia.

More likely than not, the contribution will be automatically reverted, within milliseconds, by a bot. If it's not, it'll be hand-reverted by a hardcore Wikipedia editor -- part of the statistically small, but disproportionately powerful cadre of self-appointed content cops, who seem to see their jobs as being bulwarks against change. In its zeal for the trappings of due process -- attributions, anti-\"vandalism\" policework, source checks, guidelines, and so forth -- this clique has lost sight of the net effect it's had on the site, which is to calcify and close off the free exchange of information that was so crucial to Wikipedia's early growth.\nIMO, Wikipedia has faced a fundamental challenge in recent years: namely, that content-quality efforts have threatened new content volume. I don't envy this strategic predicament, being forced -- quite literally -- to choose between quantity and quality. It's not an easy balance to strike, and, given the circumstances, Wikipedia's historic track record is quite admirable. Recently, however, the balance has tipped too far in the direction of quality-policing. And now it's starting to undermine the core tenets of the project.

{"prompt":"To give you some perspective from an ex-softie (been on the outside for 7 years now, so my experience is not recent). PMs are the hated super-political, credit grabbing ruling class of Microsoft. She was a junior PM. It's not clear what most of them actually do. When I was there, they pretended to \"design\" features, where in reality the specs were written by devs, they just took credit for them. Then they sat around in meetings and \"managed the schedule\" and \"reported status\" to one another. Since there are (or at least were) so many of them at Microsoft, the whole \"reporting status\" thing can self-perpetuate, because at some point the communication overhead begins to dominate. As a result, most PMs just interfere with work and slow things down, sometimes dramatically so.\nThis was the result of someone deciding, some 20-25 years ago, that developers couldn't handle talking to one another, and they couldn't test software themselves. I sort of agree with the latter point, but only when it comes to manual and end-to-end testing. Developers have an overriding priority: to get stuff out the door, whether it's ready or not. That's what they get promoted for. Any kind of deep testing beyond unit tests is considered, by and large, a waste of time, especially by junior devs who haven't been through support hell yet.\nPMs though? You could easily have one or two of them per team of 20 devs if they do their work well, not 1:1 as it sometimes is at Microsoft. Shit, for the past 7 years I haven't worked with any PMs at all, and my productivity is at all time high.\nSo when I found out recently that Microsoft is getting rid of the formal test discipline (a mistake, IMO, for reasons outlined above, should have merely reduced their scope to high value work), I thought about PMs as well. Bite the pillow, my PM brethren, Satya is going in dry. I imagine once the second shoe falls, Microsoft will once again be a pretty decent place to work.","completion":"Question for the ex-softie you are: How is it legal to talk, potentially critically, about the company after someone leaves?

Dealing with people is one of the most important skills you can have, period. And that often means dealing with people that are being dicks, and people who you like and are good friends. And if people are being dicks, which they inevitably will be, it's a good time for you to think about it, build your self confidence, and figure out who you are.\nI understand that sheltering them from the real world is not your motivation for this opinion, but it is the reality of what will happen.

The entire reason that people have issues with multiple versions of software is that they had to \"roll their own\" and don't bother to update it, thus they hit incompatibilities and need some sort of \"bundling\" utility like this.\nIf you're running any form of Unix, it's very likely that you already have a package management system.   It's also likely that system has more features, and is better designed from a management and consistency perspective than any one of CPAN and it's descendants (gem, cabal, etc.).\nA much better solution - either make your own packages, or use a tool like FPM (https:\/\/github.com\/jordansissel\/fpm) to make native packages, then deploy the result as you would any other package.\nI hope for an era when running CPAN or gem interacts with the package manager, building a real OS-level package and installing\/deploying it, rather than the current \"you need to run this script incantation on every production machine, oh, and you need the whole toolchain too\" idiocy.","completion":"I partly agree. I've worked at various times in my career as a developer and as a sysadmin. When I've worked with Perl is has usually been in my sysadmin role and the advantage that Perl has always had in that role is that it is part of the system. I can always rely on at least Perl 5.6 as being available as part of the system and I can write Perl scripts targeting it in almost the same way I can write scripts targeting the Bourne or Bash shells. Not having to deploy a new interpreter or package management system on my targets makes things much, much easier.\nAt the same time, I've worked as an application developer as well, and in those circumstances I generally want the latest versions libraries and interpreters. Since I'll be writing all the code expected to run with them, stability is less important. I can work around bugs and incompatibilities myself. Generally though, I need to make sure that my application interpreter and libraries don't interfere with system equivalents because that is a nightmare. So a secondary package system makes sense in this case.\nWhat I would like ideally, is a OS package manager which is capable of handling multiple versions of a programming language gracefully and will let me install a development version alongside a system version, as opposed to hacks like rvm."}

{"prompt":"Parts of this article bother me.\nLet's say that banks could set rates based on risk and this did force lower quality colleges to reduce their tuition.  Those colleges would bring in less revenue and program quality would likely suffer, possibly resulting in a feedback loop. Meanwhile, ivy league universities that are funded primarily by endowments would be able to raise their tuition without burdening their students, who would be able to afford larger loans given that they would be paying lower interest rates.  In short, rich schools get negligibly richer while poor schools get significantly poorer.  More importantly, Ivy league program quality would not improve significantly while lower tier college programs would spiral downwards.\nIf the goal is to promote quality education, the current system lets ivy league students subsidy lower tier college students to some extent.  It makes more tuition dollars available to institutions that depend entirely on tuition at the price of restricting tuition dollars available to institutions that are less reliant on them.  The status quo has significant advantages over what this article proposes.  Higher default-rates are a problem, but the lesser of several evils (unless you happen to be a banker).\nNorth of the border, university tuition is subsidied by provincial governments and regulated by them as well.  It varies from province to province, but average tuition in Canada is far lower than it is in the U.S.. In most provinces, tuition is still expensive enough to be considered an investment, but cheap enough that thrifty living, summer jobs, and a minor scholarship or two can see you through undergrad without debt.  It's a different approach that's worth considering.","completion":"Random aside: I was under the impression that very few schools were funded by endowments in any significant way. Harvard was a big exception to that rule, which hit them really hard in 2008. They had a team of high profile Wall Street traders who did a pretty good job raising their endowment to the point where it funded at least a third of their operations. With this newfound wealth, Harvard started a whole lot of construction projects which were then cut short in 2008. Another response to the financial crisis: Harvard stopped offering their students free coffee."}

I've met a bunch of other Glass users with whom I've brought this up in a similar way to: \"Why do you self-deprecatingly call yourself an asshole for wearing Glass?\" and as far as I know they stop, but that may just be them not doing it around me.\nDo other Glass users feel like they need to call themselves names?

{"prompt":"As a Silicon Valley native currently living in Chicago, I've always found it disappointing that Groupon is the poster child of innovation and entrepreneurship in Chicago. They seem to lack a solid business plan and have a history of deliberately misleading investors and businesses. Far more impressive companies, such as 37signals or GrubHub, are based here that deserve that kind of attention instead.\nI very much doubt the legitimacy of this story, but I was in a barbershop a few weeks ago, where the owner told me about one of the Groupon executives who was in the shop earlier. He was saying we shouldn't expect Groupon to be around in 10 years because the company's plan is to collect as much cash as possible, fire everybody, and shut down, keeping the money for the investors. While I doubt a Groupon executive would have actually said that in a barbershop, I can believe that actually was their long-term plan, but if things keep up at their current rate, I'm not sure if Groupon will even last that long.","completion":"I might disagree with you on that.

{"prompt":"There was a fantastic article and analysis I read some weeks ago that addressed this issue, and I'm trying desperately to find it. However, I remember the key points, and I'll surmise them here:\n- The A-10's survivability is overrated. The Air Force conducted studies after both Gulf Wars and found that the A-10 was taking higher damage per sortie when compared in '91 to '03. That Iraq's air defense was in shambles didn't seem to diminish the fact that the A-10 was becoming more vulnerable to more sophisticated weapons. Technology has made cheaper weapons more effective since the 1970s in which this was designed. In a higher threat environment, the lack of sophisticated sensors, threat identification, and ECM is seen as not boding well.\n- The A-29 is a fantastic plane. But it's giving the A-10 a run for it's money, not the F-35. In the low-threat COIN environment, it has all of the benefits of the A-10 with none of the drawbacks. That famous cannon isn't always idea against militants in the mountains when you're worried about spraying your own troops. That the A-19 can carry small guided weapons just like the A-10 gives it capabilities where it counts. And it's half to a third of the price to purchase and maintain.\nSo the A-10 is getting squashed from two sides: The F-35 can penetrate the high-threat environment, and provide CAS in a lethal SAM environment, while the A-29 can provide CAS\/COIN against militants in a low to non-existent threat environment. There is no middle ground. It left when air defense systems gained the sophisticated tracking and accuracy that wasn't there in the 1970s and 80s.\nThe A-10 was a fantastic plane and well designed for the time in which it was envisioned to fight. But even I agree that it's time has passed. Like the F-14, it's sad to see it go, but I think it's the right call.","completion":">So the A-10 is getting squashed from two sides: The F-35 can penetrate the high-threat environment, and provide CAS in a lethal SAM environment, while the A-29 can provide CAS\/COIN against militants in a low to non-existent threat environment.

While the A-29 is fine for the CAS role against irregulars, in a war against a country with lots of armor you'd really want to have the A-10."}

Even in the limited areas where elephant populations are not highly endangered, there's still substantial controversy around any practice that allows the ivory market to legitimately revive itself, since it not only provides cover for black-market ivory, it also fuels the kind of demand that leads to increased poaching in places where elephants remain truly endangered.\nYou should also know that what you saw on that video is the exception, not the rule. In the all-too-common cases where elephants are killed illegally, any stray documentary crews would also be killed, with all the bodies left to rot.

And it strongly suggests a rather fragile relationship between the garment and the wearer -- I can change in multiple of 25 separate measurements within a few months to a years time -- does this render a suit poor-fitting?\nThe made-to-measure alternative exists, and for many or most, it's a more-than-acceptable alternative for either formal or casual clothing.  With correctly chosen measuring points, and if necessary, some additional tailoring, garments can be made to fit quite well.  Cloth is pretty fungible.  Sticking to conservative fashions, styles, and cuts means you'll have something that will wear well for years.  And in a world in which off-the-rack sizing is increasingly problematic (aggressively styled cuts with little sizing leeway result in more frustrated customers), it's increasingly an option.  There are a few vendors in the space, though I feel it's still waiting for its true visionary.","completion":">> \"The suit is dead for any number of reason, dittos bespoke clothing.\"\nBarney Stinson would beg to differ: http:\/\/vimeo.com\/17152345"}

I know you don't need blend, but you can't just go in and add a single line to change the color of an invalid toolbox border--the alternative to blend is to (afaik) copy the entire style resource that the element uses from MSDN, dig into it to find the appropriate 10 lines of useless markup that surround one word property.\nCSS is infinitely more simple than XAML style resources.\nI'm also very partial to the pseudo separation of concerns where HTML is for semantics, and CSS is for style, and JS is for effects.

If wages and tips do not equal the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour during any pay period, the employer is required to increase cash wages to compensate.[2]\nSo while it may be true that servers might get a base pay of something stupid like $2.13, they are guaranteed that they will make at least the federal minimum wage (which still sucks but that is a different topic). And... many states go above and beyond what the federal government requires[3]. I'm getting a little tired of the whole \"but they live off tips\" rhetoric. Tip what you want and don't let society pressure you into tipping more than you desire.

{"prompt":"I began this piece raring to disagree, but I find it hard to fault his logic. A human right to unimpeded use of carriages would seem hilarious today, and a right to the use of landline phones will likely become so in the next decade.\nWe don't want to regulate specific rights as reactions to the particular issues of the day, we want to distill those issues to their essence so that we can meaningfully protect freedoms that are fundamental to meaningful human existence.\nHowever, as others have noted here, this article leaves a couple of important points unaddressed.\nFirstly, how can we be sure that the internet isn't fundamental? I can imagine arguing (in an earlier time) that legal counsel shouldn't be a human right, because we'll have something better than the legal system at some point. Yet thousands of years of human development have led only to a more complex legal system with the same fundamental ideas. Maybe the internet isn't horse-riding, maybe it's the invention of law. How do we know?\nSecondly, if internet access isn't fundamental, then what is its more essential formulation? Being banned from the internet today makes you deaf, dumb and blind; much like being banned from electricity would cripple you. The difference is, nobody's trying to make three strikes laws for the power grid. We need to protect something. So what is it? The idea of free access to information? Ability to form and join networks? It's clearly not anything that's currently protected.\nUnfortunately, there is more than just an academic interest at stake here. It's well and good to say \"ha ha, you see, I have a new and interesting perspective\", but this is a situation where there are actual losses being made in terms of real people's access to the internet. Unless Vint Cerf is trying to say that's not important, perhaps it's a little counterproductive to make an article that shoots down a core idea for internet freedom without providing anything else of substance to fill its place.","completion":"Some technologies are too big to be abstracted away, such as Press.  The internet is one of these things.

When I had an issue with it, I cracked open the code and was quickly deterred from digging deeper.

Here's an example of getting a box up and running with 7ish commands: http:\/\/www.linux-mag.com\/id\/7673\/ For a complete development environment, you only need to additionally mount a shared filesystem and write an entry into your ssh config.\nAll that said, I do think that there is value in having a command line tool which abstracts various machine provisioning APIs. I know that such a thing exists for cloud providers, but I suspect local VMs have some unique concerns.

{"prompt":"There are a lot of poor or outdated answers to the question (arguing a lack of accelerated graphics, for example).\nThe number one reason current browsers are implemented in C++ is momentum. A browser has a lot of parts that do a lot of things; they're big code bases.\nJIT compilation technology on the JVM (and elsewhere) these days is pulling within 20-50% of static C\/C++ code.\nIf you were coding from scratch these days, would you start with C\/C++? I doubt it, especially when you know you can get most of the same performance with other platforms.\nBy far the most important reason to choose a modern VM environment is security. Except in a vanishingly small number of cases, everything should always be bounds checked. The \"native\" part of a browser should be as small as possible, with a highly constrained and thoroughly checked API. Take away manual memory allocation and use after free goes away. Take away pointers and buffer overflows go away. You want as much of the browser code as possible to be running in a managed environment.\nIn my opinion every line of native code carries risks that don't exist in managed environments. Yes, properly written C code won't exhibit those problems -- but it seems to be extraordinarily difficult to do that. Security flaws are still being found in browsers, decades later.\nAnd yes, security flaws exist in systems like the JVM. Those mostly come from native code as well, but some of them are because of the design. The JVM's \"native part\" is just too big. Too much is done there that doesn't need to be.\nWith a massive native code base it's just a huge problem to verify everything.\nSo Rust and Go are quite interesting. It's critically important that these languages remove \"unsafe\" features from something like C\/C++, and lose almost nothing in the process.\nAnd around the corner, environments like the JVM can auto-vectorize on the fly (http:\/\/bugs.sun.com\/bugdatabase\/view_bug.do?bug_id=7116452), knocking down yet another performance-parity barrier.","completion":"Here's an old, but good thread relevant to the discussion:\nhttp:\/\/gcc.gnu.org\/ml\/gcc\/2002-08\/msg00552.html"}

As Whitehead said, \"The safest general characterization of the philosophical tradition is that it consists of a series of footnotes to Plato.\" The Stoics are also very approachable.\nIn the opinion of my teachers, the pivotal figures in the history of philosophy were Plato, Aristotle, Descartes and Kant.

{"prompt":"America will be about the last place to attempt this, if the past (and our current welfare) are any guide.\nIt's an interesting concept. My immediate reaction is that it creates disincentives to work. In theory it does, but the only data we have is those who are currently on welfare and do not work -- but maybe those people were basically not going to work anyway! We have no competing group of people who are on welfare yet still CHOOSE to work to better their lives, because as soon as someone gets a job, no more benefits! So it's natural that an outsize chunk of people on public assistance don't work -- and the ones who stay on the longest, of course, don't WANT to work.  But it undercounts those who go on the system then back out of it as they get work.\nOther things that seem \"obvious\" to result: inflation. If everyone can afford $x for housing, why should housing costs not go up by a similar amount? The same way 2 incomes is now \"normal\", and the same way giving tax deductions on mortgage interest to make housing \"more affordable\" means, now that everyone can afford more housing, housing is bid up.\nI don't know, but it's a fascinating experiment, anyone who is not paying for it should be in favor of this experiment -- unless you just hate poor people.","completion":"I don't think killing motivation would be something to worry about.

Now what are the cons of PostgreSQL?\n1) It's hard to install and manage, which could explain why Postgre's adoption is fairly low.\n2) MySQL is used and proven to scale on very large installments (Yahoo, Facebook, Google - just to name a few). Postgre's usage is much lower (Skype and Reddit from those I know of)\n3) Due to the adoption of MySQL it's very easy to get help and to buy help. For example: http:\/\/mysqlperformanceblog.com offers great advice on everything MySQL. Due to Postgre's smaller user base it's harder to get or buy help.\n4) The development of \"MySQL and MySQL tools\" is very rapid. Check out Drizzle, Xtradb, xtrabackup, innodb plugin, rethinkdb.com (this is just a few, there are tons of other engines and tools under development). It's unclear to me how rapid Postgre's development is (for example, they still lack a decent replication), but I doubt Postgre's development is as rapid as MySQL's.\n5) The advances features of Postgres are not that needed in most web applications. If they were that needed, more people would have used Postgres. I.e. Postgres has a lot of non-essential features, while it lacks some essential features (such as decent replication).\nThe bottom line is that MySQL is proven, easy to use and install, is under heavy development, is backed up by billion dollar companies and has a very large user base. MySQL is also built mostly for web-applications and offers _great_ performance, great tools and great replication.","completion":"Having dealt with many MySQL installations and, finally, a nice, internet-scale Postgres site, I can quite comfortably challenge the notion that MySQL has \"great\" replication.\nIt's certainly tough to beat for trivial topology or trivial database size, but, beyond that, MySQL statement-based replication is remarkably fragile. What's worse is, if a slave is far enough behind, it's possible that it will never catch up (hint: think about I\/O contention with replication and whether it's possible to separate logs adequately). Once that happens, it's full dump time. Anything remotely fancy, like filtering out certain schemas (which MySQL calls \"database,\" but it's really just a namespace), and a single developer discovering cross-schema UPDATEs, and That's All She Wrote.\nWith Slony, after learning the admittedly bizarre administrative interface, everything was a dream. Swapping master and slave is fast and easy, even if there are other slaves out there. Full dump? Never heard of it! Certainly, slony does do the equivalent when bringing up a new slave, but the locking requirement is nowhere near as onerous, nor is the overall performance hit.  Replication happens at the table level, not the whole database.\nThe amount of time I've spent fixing broken MySQL replication easily dwarfs the amount of time I've spent learning and experimenting and fixing (after breaking on purpose, usually) Slony."}

XML is too hefty and wasteful. YAML has had a bad history of insecure encoders and decoders but overall is my favorite data format. However, it still has the downside of needing a special decoder since browsers don't support it, and it requires specific indentation for its hierarchical data format which is wasteful in its own way.\nThat just leaves JSON in my opinion.

{"prompt":"The real challenge is with enterprise applications that need a rich UI - this is where Flex was a good solution.  Saying \"just use HTML5\" is fine when you serve the consumer space; it's not if you serve enterprises.\nHTML5 is just not a go-er for enterprise products that need a rich UI.  Even if it could do everything Flex can (and it can't, yet), you need a modern browser.  Many enterprises still use IE6.  I'd say 60% of our customers are on IE6; and the remaining 40% use IE7.  Demanding IE9 would make an enterprise product dead in the water.\nFlex fitted here.  You have enterprises who say \"no more client server, everything should be web\" but then don't give you the web platform to be able to deliver the required user experience (i.e. you must use IE6\/7).  Flex let you deliver on the web, with a rich UI, on legacy browsers.\nSo you had a choice:\n- Stay on client\/server (lots of enterprises won't consider you)\n- Develop for HTML5 (not quite prime time, no-one can buy your product as won't work on their browsers)\n- Dumb down the UI and deliver in IE6 (workable for some projects, but not for many - some products really do need a rich UI.  Especially not doable when porting existing rich client\/server app to being webbased - clients don't like backwards steps on the UI)\n- Develop in Flex\nSo it's all well and good saying people yelled 'iceberg' but really you're between a rock and a hard place, and even with this news I'm sure most Flex enterprise developers would make the same decision again - because there really weren't many alternatives.","completion":"60%? http:\/\/www.ie6countdown.com\/ doing most of your business in china? by asking them to upgrade you are doing them a favor"}

I'm not sure I understand why the format has to be updated so much.\nEDIT: I'm also curious as to how this affects all the other readers out there. In E-Reader world, we live way back in the dark ages where every device is funky. Does this add more to the funkiness of trying to cross-deploy? Was there something so wrong with Keep it Simple, Stupid? It's text, for goodness sake. It's a book. I know I sound like grumpy-old-guy, but hell guys, ya think we could manage one format for displaying the world's oldest persistent communications format -- simple text -- without too many revisions?","completion":"What about children books.

{"prompt":"I have a Linux laptop on which I run a tiling window manager (in my case, Xmonad), and nothing else. No system tray, no quick launch bar, nothing.\n(if you're not familiar with tiling window managers, they're window managers in which windows are arranged automatically to a) fully occupy the screen and b) never overlap. They're extremely customizable, but typically you'll have a vertical half of your screen with a main app, and the other half with all the other apps \"stacked\", with keyboard shortcuts to toggle between them and adjust various parameters (e.g. split orientation). You typically also get virtual desktops. The whole thing is fully keyboard driven (on my Xmonad, cmd + shift + enter opens a new terminal, and cmd + shift + c kills the currently selected window), and once you get used to it it's a usability dream).\nOn it, I have 2 graphical applications installed: a terminal emulator, because that's where I do all my work (and can launch other minor applications, such as a PDF viewer, if needed), and surf, a tab-less\/control-less\/URL field-less browser that you launch by typing `surf <url>`.\nPeople make fun of me for this weird archaic setup, but it's the most productive machine I've ever used. Tiling window managers don't get in the way, and make it painful obvious when you have non work stuff open. surf forces me to not fuck around with 15000 irrelevant tabs open. It sounds like it would be a terribly crippled experience, but in practice it does not impede my workflow at all - it keeps me focused. It's gotten to the point that when I hear colleagues who complain about all their open tabs and how screwed they would be if their Chrome crashes, I feel like they come from another planet.\nI don't like the whole \"have some discipline\" argument. Humans are notoriously bad at discipline- environment plays as much of a role as self control (try surrounding the most hardcore fitness nut by candy 24\/7 and see how long they last). The point of our tools is that they should enable us to be who we want to be.","completion":"ohh so this is what I've seen on my coworker computer :)"}

Tolstoy carefully builds the idea of Christianity as a philosophy of non-violence, anarchy and peaceful disobedience, claiming that that was the true teaching of Jesus Christ and the reason why Christians have been persecuted and killed everywhere - before the whole thing was transformed into a dogmatic religion.\nTolstoy argues that in order to truly renounce violence, one must not support it in any way, including through proxies - the State (which is backed by the military), the Government and Legal System (which has the police, the judges and the prisons), the corporations (which support the state and use violence to aquire resources), stay away from the Church and religion, Patriotism (which is a brain washing methodology) and so on.\nFrom the perspective of the state, the church, etc, those ideas are very dangerous.\nBut from the standpoint of humanism, respect for life, the right way to live, these ideas are the truth.\nUnfortunately, some people inspired by Tolstoy, like Ghandi or Martin Luther King or Lennon have been murdered, but only after fundamentally changing our society for the better.\nTolstoy himself was excomunicated from the Orthodox Church and burried on a hill.\nThere is inherent danger in telling people to just love one another.

{"prompt":"I can't take Katz' suggestions for JavaScript seriously. He desperately wants JS to be his blub (ruby) and doesn't seriously think about how to accomplish his goals with what the language provides.\n> There are two very common problems here. First, this has changed contexts. We can fix this by allowing a binding as a second parameter, but it means that we need to make sure that every time we refactor to a lambda we make sure to accept a binding parameter and pass it in. The var self = this pattern emerged in JavaScript primarily because of the lack of correspondence.\nOr, you could use Function.prototype.bind where it's needed. Only functions where an execution context is frequently provided should accept an execution context (as sugar, basically), and it's generally better to assume prudent use of bind().

You just enclose a variable and assign from within the callback.

However, proponents of a functional style would argue that you should be filtering your list first so that you only have to deal with interesting values, and so that there is no need to break: If you need `break`, use for ()!\nI mean, come on, this is the same guy who wrote a reopenClass function in Ember.js -- for a language with plainly open prototypes.\nThis is nothing but a post glorifying Ruby and bashing JS for not being Ruby.
